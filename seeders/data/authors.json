    "biography": "<p>G. W. F. Hegel was born in Stuttgart, Germany, on August 27, 1770. In 1805 he became a professor at Jena University and began to write the first of his great philosophical texts there. A key figure in the explosion of philosophy in Germany at the turn of the nineteenth century, the sheer breadth of Hegel’s thinking has influenced political philosophers for centuries. Closely associated with the University of Berlin in the latter part of his life, Hegel died from disease—possibly cholera—in 1831 at the age of 61.</p>",

At the age of 17 he moved to Athens in Greece to begin an education in philosophy under Plato, one of the founders of European philosophy, at his renowned Academy. On Plato’s death in 347 B.C.E., Aristotle moved back to Macedonia to tutor the young Alexander the Great. But in 335 B.C.E. he returned to Athens and established his own school, the Lyceum. Political unrest forced Aristotle to leave Athens again in 322 B.C.E., and he died shortly afterwards on the island of Euboea.</p>",

He spent his boyhood in Prague, Czechoslovakia, but his time there ended when Nazi Germany invaded and the Jewish Gellners escaped to Great Britain. Ernest eventually obtained degrees from Oxford and the London School of Economics. Having fled his homeland because of the Nazis’ extreme nationalism, it is perhaps not surprising that Gellner came to study the phenomenon. He finally returned to Prague in 1993 as the founding director of the Centre for the Study of Nationalism at Central European University. He died there just two years later, at the age of 69.</p>",

    "biography": "<p>The French philosopher and historian Michel Foucault was one of the most influential figures in twentieth century thought. Born in 1926 in Poitiers, France, he was a central player in the development of “French theory”—a loosely affiliated intellectual movement of iconoclastic thinkers working in 1960s Paris, whose work reverberated through university departments across the world from the 1970s onwards. Foucault was a pioneering analyst of hidden and repressed histories whose work, in his own words, sought to “show up, transform, and reverse the systems which quietly order us about”—the invisible structures that confine and define us as humans. \nAlong with the short, influential “What is an Author?” (1969), Foucault was the author of a number of seminal texts including The History of Madness (1961), The Order of Things (1966), Archaeology of Knowledge (1969), Discipline and Punish (1975), and The History of Sexuality (1976-1984). Through these he came to be known as the greatest analyst of the interactions between power and social life, consistently unsettling our deepest assumptions about what is true, real, or natural. By the time of his death from complications of AIDS in 1984 he was widely recognized as the most influential thinker in the world.</p>",
