    "content": "G. W. F. Hegel’s <i>Phenomenology of Spirit</i> (German title: <i>Phänomenologie des Geistes</i>) is a unique work in Western philosophy in terms of its style, aims, and scope. Although it has been in and out of fashion since its publication in 1807, it is still one of the most influential works of the past two centuries. It consists of a long “Preface,” a short methodological “Introduction,” (that is, an introduction in which Hegel lays out the philosophical approach he will be using) and then eight chapters that chart the development of what Hegel calls <a id=\"m-ref3\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1035\" data-type=\"Term\">consciousness.</a> It should be noted that Hegel’s view of consciousness differs from what is commonly understood by the word. The philosopher Immanuel Kant believed that there was a bridge between mind and matter. He argued that as you observe something through your senses it is understood, or interpreted, through <a id=\"m-ref4\" data-score=\"4\" data-id=\"1034\" data-type=\"Term\">concepts.</a> In this way, someone suffering from amnesia, with no memory of ever having seen an orange, would not be so confused as you might expect when finally seeing one for the “first” time. Hegel, too, saw these concepts as “rules” that allow us to work out the properties of an object we see; the most general of these concepts form part of the <a id=\"m-ref5\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1029\" data-type=\"Term\">categories</a> Hegel identified. Hegel also argued that the individual consciousness tries to find self-knowledge through meeting other individual consciousnesses, so a collective consciousness builds up over time—an idea that is not as difficult to understand as it might seem. For example, a man who has lived his whole life in a desert can still understand what snow is by having it explained using concepts he is familiar with such as “white” and “cold.” This idea of a collective consciousness is crucial to understanding Hegel. In fact, he developed it further by examining the collective consciousnesses of societies that he thought were crucial to the development of Western consciousness as a whole. These ideas had an enormous impact on the political evolution of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It is perhaps because of the book’s ambition and the variety of its themes that there are still arguments about the text. Scholars, such as the British professor of philosophy <a id=\"m-ref6\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"9856\" data-type=\"Person\">Stephen Houlgate,</a> have pointed out that the text is best understood as an introduction to Hegel’s larger philosophical system.<a href=\"#m-en-1\">1</a> Others, such as the French philosopher <a id=\"m-ref7\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"9857\" data-type=\"Person\">Jean Hyppolite,</a> believe that <i>Phenomenology</i> was a kind of <i><a id=\"m-ref8\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1026\" data-type=\"Term\">Bildungsroman</a> </i>(philosophical novel), telling the tale of the coming-of-age, education, and psychological growth of a character called “consciousness.” This has led to the idea that Hegel was examining a process as it was actually unfolding.<a href=\"#m-en-2\">2</a> ",

    "content": "Hegel’s thought was certainly not limited to the period in which he was writing. The spirit of revolution that had found expression in both the American <a data-score=\"10\" href=\"#m-gl-RevolutionaryWar\" id=\"m-ref134\">Revolutionary War</a> (in which the young United States fought against the forces of the British Empire for their independence) and the French Revolution had certainly revealed aspects of modernity that were unique to their times. Few individual works of philosophy have been so fertile or liable to swing in and out of fashion as <i>Phenomenology of Spirit</i>. While it is still relevant more than 200 years after its publication, the nature of that relevance has varied according to the time and location of its supporters. Much so-called “continental” <a data-score=\"6\" href=\"#m-gl-Philosophyofnature\" id=\"m-ref135\">philosophy,</a> (a set of nineteenth- and twentieth-century philosophies from mainland Europe), especially from <a data-score=\"10\" href=\"#m-gl-WorldWarII\" id=\"m-ref136\">World War II</a> onward, has been virtually impossible to understand without Hegel.One central reason for this is that a number of leading French intellectuals attended the philosopher <a data-score=\"7\" id=\"m-ref137\" data-id=\"9861\" data-type=\"Person\">Alexandre Kojève’s</a> lectures on <i>Phenomenology</i> in the 1930s.<a href=\"#m-en-19\">2</a> Kojève’s distinctive reading of the text drew heavily on Karl Marx and the German philosopher <a data-score=\"7\" id=\"m-ref138\" data-id=\"9852\" data-type=\"Person\">Martin Heidegger’s</a> <a data-score=\"10\" href=\"#m-gl-Phenomenology\" id=\"m-ref139\">phenomenology</a> (in the sense of “an inquiry into the nature of consciousness”). This should not be confused with “phenomenology” as Hegel used the term. Hegel, for example, emphasized the master-slave dialectic and the themes of psychological integrity and the self’s quest for completion. Among the attendees were the sociologist <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref140\" data-id=\"9837\" data-type=\"Person\">Raymond Aron,</a> the philosopher <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref141\" data-id=\"9883\" data-type=\"Person\">Jean-Paul Sartre,</a> and the psychoanalyst <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref142\" data-id=\"9862\" data-type=\"Person\">Jacques Lacan.</a>Sartre’s masterpiece <i>Being and Nothingness</i> is filled with Hegelian terms and ideas, such as the relation between “being-for-self and being-for-others” in his analysis of the phenomenology of human relations. Lacan, who was also deeply affected by the philosopher Jean Hyppolite’s commentary on <i>Phenomenology</i>,<a href=\"#m-en-20\">3</a> took ideas from Hyppolite when he came to propose his own theory of the development of the psyche. Politically speaking, it was Marx and not Hegel who dominated twentieth-century history. But the collapse of the <a data-score=\"7\" href=\"#m-gl-SovietUnionorUSSR\" id=\"m-ref143\">Soviet Union</a> and its obvious failings in the period following World War II caused some, notably the political theorist <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref144\" data-id=\"9848\" data-type=\"Person\">Francis Fukuyama,</a> to reassess Kojève’s interpretation of Hegel and reapply it to the late twentieth century.",

    "content": "G. W. F. Hegel, the author of <i>Phenomenology of Spirit</i> (1807) was born in the German city of Stuttgart on August 27, 1770. At the age of three Hegel began his formal education. He studied at a gymnasium (a school with a reputation for being highly academic) from the age of six, then at the age of 18 went to the Tübinger Stift, a boarding school attached to the University of Tübinger. Although this school usually trained young men for entry into the Church, not all its students ended up following that career. Hegel left Tübinger in 1793 and found work as a tutor for an aristocratic family. He wrote several important essays during this period. In 1801 he moved to a city called Jena in Prussia—a country in what is today Northern Germany—where he became a lecturer at the university. By 1805 he had been promoted to the rank of “extraordinary professor” but he did not receive a salary, meaning that it became a financial necessity for him to finish <i>Phenomenology of Spirit</i>. In 1806 a battle took place at Jena between the French emperor <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref243\" data-id=\"9841\" data-type=\"Person\">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> and the <a data-score=\"5\" href=\"#m-gl-Prussia\" id=\"m-ref244\">Prussian</a> army. The town was almost destroyed and many university students fled. <i>Phenomenology</i> was published soon after.By this time, Hegel had a reputation as an important thinker. <i>Phenomenology</i> was the starting point for all his later philosophical texts. It was an important step in the development of a philosophical field known as <a data-score=\"10\" href=\"#m-gl-Idealism\" id=\"m-ref245\">Idealism</a> (the idea that reality is made in the mind). Hegel’s ideas were very complex, and there are still arguments as to their true meaning.",

    "content": "<i>Phenomenology</i> is about how to approach the question “What really matters?” According to Hegel all reality is constructed by the mind although, crucially, the mind itself is not aware of it. Reality for Hegel is a vast, complex system that he called the <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref246\" data-id=\"1019\" data-type=\"Term\">Absolute.</a> According to Idealism, reality is not made up of the things that exist outside our heads; it is actually <i>within</i> the mind. But how can we begin to understand something so complex? Hegel’s Absolute changed over time. He argued that only by understanding the Absolute in its entirety could we arrive at truth; understanding only part of it could logically only be partly true. Yet even partial truths were worth exploring, he believed; each part must contain a glimmer of truth. By carefully exploring it we might get closer to an understanding.Imagine that a patient who cannot remember anything he has ever learned has just been given an orange that has been sliced into 16 segments. He has no memory of oranges at all. He is now told to examine the objects one at a time. After examining the first segment he might conclude that oranges are in fact small, wedge-shaped objects. As he explores further he might then realize his earlier theory was wrong, since the objects seem to fit together. The patient now moves through stages of thinking “an orange is wedge-shaped,” “an orange is a semisphere,” and so on. Each step provides more information about what an orange actually is. But the curved shape of the first segment still <i>suggests </i>that the orange might be round even before it has been fully reassembled.<i>Phenomenology</i>, however, is as much about the methodology of discovery—that is, the way discoveries are made—as it is about coming to conclusions. We can easily imagine the patient working out the nature of an orange by using his senses. But understanding the idea of the Absolute is more difficult. Hegel felt we needed a new way of looking at objects. Questions surrounding the nature of objects are part of a branch of philosophy known as <a data-score=\"10\" href=\"#m-gl-Ontology\" id=\"m-ref247\">ontology</a> that dates back to the ancient Greek philosopher <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref248\" data-id=\"9836\" data-type=\"Person\">Aristotle.</a> <i>Phenomenology</i> examines two important elements of this field: <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref249\" data-id=\"1029\" data-type=\"Term\">categories</a> and truth. Categories can be thought of as a way of separating objects from one another. Aristotle, for instance, created categories such as “substance,” “quality,” and “place.” Without categories, Hegel argued, we can say nothing about what there <i>is</i>. Hegel’s second concept of ontology tells us which things are “true” or “real.” For Hegel, not everything was <i>equally </i>real. Chairs and numbers both exist, for example, but one is more “real” than the other.Ideas like this were dominating German thought at the time. The philosopher <a data-score=\"7\" id=\"m-ref250\" data-id=\"9860\" data-type=\"Person\">Immanuel Kant’s</a> <i><a data-score=\"8\" id=\"m-ref251\" data-id=\"1037\" data-type=\"Term\">Critique of Pure Reason</a></i> (1781) had started an explosion of philosophical activity in Germany. Several different views were then developed. The author and philosopher <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref252\" data-id=\"9858\" data-type=\"Person\">F. H. Jacobi</a> tried to base knowledge on ethics, faith, and feeling. The poet and philosopher Friedrich <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref253\" data-id=\"9886\" data-type=\"Person\">Schlegel</a> and the writer <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref254\" data-id=\"9871\" data-type=\"Person\">Novalis</a> emphasized the <a data-score=\"10\" href=\"#m-gl-Intrinsicvalueofnature\" id=\"m-ref255\">intrinsic value of nature.</a> The philosophers <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref256\" data-id=\"9878\" data-type=\"Person\">K. L. Reinhold</a> and <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref257\" data-id=\"9845\" data-type=\"Person\">Johann Gottlieb Fichte</a> tried to add depth to Kant’s theories. Hegel and his friend Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref258\" data-id=\"9884\" data-type=\"Person\">Schelling</a> both put forward a more systematic explanation. Hegel assumed that his readers would have a good understanding of Western philosophy, and especially recent developments in the field. Because of this assumption, however, <i>Phenomenology</i> can be difficult for a modern reader.",

    "content": "<i>Phenomenology </i>is important because of its position in the history of philosophy. The text is seen as Hegel’s masterpiece, and it marks the end of the period of German idealist philosophy that began with Kant’s <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i> (1781). This intense period of intellectual thought is almost unique. Only Athens in the fifth century b.c.e. and the <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref259\" data-id=\"1046\" data-type=\"Term\">European Renaissance</a>—the period following the Middle Ages when European thinkers and artists turned to ancient Greek and Roman models to reinvigorate European culture—can match it. And even within this extraordinary period, <i>Phenomenology </i>stands out as one of its most important texts.The text can also be seen as the point at which philosophy’s boundaries with other disciplines began to blur. Although sociology (the study of the nature and structure of society), history, economics, and anthropology (the study of human cultures) did not develop until years later, all were influenced by this text. Even on its own, <i>Phenomenology</i> is one of the key texts of the nineteenth century. Many of Hegel’s core ideas, such as those on <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref260\" data-id=\"1020\" data-type=\"Term\">alienation</a> (at its core, the process whereby individuals begin to see the world around them as alien) and <a data-score=\"10\" href=\"#m-gl-Recognition\" id=\"m-ref261\">recognition,</a> are still debated today. For most of the twentieth century, <i>Phenomenology</i> was seen from a Marxist viewpoint—that is, it was understood, particularly in the <a data-score=\"7\" href=\"#m-gl-SovietUnionorUSSR\" id=\"m-ref262\">Soviet Union,</a> according to the analysis of society proposed in the work of the economist and social theorist <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref263\" data-id=\"9866\" data-type=\"Person\">Karl Marx.</a> Paradoxically, the collapse of the Soviet Union and the decline of <a data-score=\"10\" href=\"#m-gl-Marxism\" id=\"m-ref264\">Marxism</a> appears to have reinvigorated interest in Hegel’s idea. He has regained the attention of leading scholars such as the American social theorist <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref265\" data-id=\"9848\" data-type=\"Person\">Francis Fukuyama,</a> for example. It is not just the variety of topics in <i>Phenomenology</i> that makes it so important: the text succeeds in shaping them into a single philosophical vision.Since Hegel, no scholar has tried to write anything so ambitious as <i>Phenomenology</i>. Hegel’s account of the history of Western <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref266\" data-id=\"1035\" data-type=\"Term\">consciousness</a> was a massive task. But it was also only half the picture. He also tried to include an analysis of philosophical and cultural movements and the way they connected to one other. The text explored ideas that were quite different from earlier philosophy. Unlike much of Hegel’s work, these ideas in their raw form are easy to understand. Hegel’s argument was that philosophical truths emerged as history progressed, that the two developed side by side. Hegel’s ideas had a profound impact on the course of history. Understanding the importance of such <a data-score=\"10\" href=\"#m-gl-Historicism\" id=\"m-ref267\">historicism</a> (the role of history on society) can do much to help students of any field understand historical events after 1806.",

Jena was a city in the state of Prussia, in what is today northern Germany. Having defeated Prussia, Napoleon began to demolish the Holy Roman Empire, the political landscape within which Hegel lived and worked. Fortunately, Hegel sent most of the manuscript to his publisher before he fled Jena with the final pages of <i>Phenomenology</i>, thereby ensuring its publication.

    "content": "To G. W. F. Hegel, the term “<a href=\"#m-gl-Phenomenology\" id=\"m-ref24\" data-score=\"10\">phenomenology”</a> had a very specific, complex meaning. Hegel was referring to what he described as a <i>scientific</i> treatment of the experience of an idealized <a id=\"m-ref25\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1035\" data-type=\"Term\">consciousness.</a> We can think of this aspect of the work, perhaps, as a very sophisticated and rigorous thought experiment. As we have seen, Hegel’s definition of consciousness is quite particular. But so is his use of the term “scientific.” It is important to note that the German word for science, <i>Wissenschaft</i>, is used for <i>any</i> systematic form of inquiry, not just the natural sciences. So, we should view Hegel’s approach not as scientific but as <i>systematic</i>, a process with a beginning, middle, and end. Although Hegel expected his readers to understand this looser sense of the term, his move from normal modes of thought is still significant. Indeed, his idea to create a science out of consciousness’s experience and his method for explaining its development were both highly original. Hegel was a part of a larger community of German intellectuals who were all investigating various aspects of the modern world in which they lived. This diverse group had two things in common, aside from shared language and culture. First they had an almost obsessive interest in <a id=\"m-ref26\" data-score=\"7\" data-id=\"1031\" data-type=\"Term\">classical Greek</a> culture inspired by the art historian <a id=\"m-ref27\" data-score=\"7\" data-id=\"9895\" data-type=\"Person\">Joachim Winkelmann’s</a> <i>The History of Ancient Art </i>(1764)<i>. </i>German academics from Johann Wolfgang von <a id=\"m-ref28\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"9850\" data-type=\"Person\">Goethe</a> and <a id=\"m-ref29\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"9853\" data-type=\"Person\">Johann Gottfried Herder</a> to <a id=\"m-ref30\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"9885\" data-type=\"Person\">Friedrich Schiller,</a> and even Hegel’s contemporary Friedrich <a id=\"m-ref31\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"9886\" data-type=\"Person\">Schlegel,</a> had been inspired by the idea that Greek art was the finest the world had ever seen. Nostalgia for the world of the Greek city-state, the <i>Polis</i>, was widespread. So was the belief that the modern world could never achieve either the same levels of beauty in art, or virtue in political character, as the Greeks. Hegel, however, differed. While he shared their popular love of Greece, he set out to combat nostalgia.The second uniting principle was that the work of these intellectuals can be viewed either as a critical response to, or development of, <a href=\"#m-gl-Kantian\" id=\"m-ref32\" data-score=\"4\">Kant’s</a> so-called “critical” philosophy, a dominant idea of the 1780s and early 1790s.

    "content": "<i>Phenomenology of Spirit </i>deals with issues that were central to the intellectual life of the period. Hegel was working in a complicated field known as <a href=\"#m-gl-Idealism\" id=\"m-ref33\" data-score=\"10\">Idealism</a> that had many subdivisions. One of the subdivisions was in direct opposition to <a href=\"#m-gl-Materialism\" id=\"m-ref34\" data-score=\"10\">Materialism.</a> Immanuel Kant’s view, known as Transcendental <a href=\"#m-gl-Idealism\" id=\"m-ref35\" data-score=\"10\">Idealism,</a> states that the mind shapes the world around us into what we perceive as reality; whether reality is ultimately just in the mind was not something Kant committed to. Hegel’s view, known as Absolute Idealism, differs from Transcendental Idealism in a number of ways. Hegel insists that reality can only be understood as a whole, and introduces the idea of a collective consciousness. This argues against the idea that those around an individual tend to influence his or her views. Hegel also created the concept of a developmental history, according to which societies examine ways of thinking, reject them, and replace them with something more refined. Since these philosophical ideas had to do with the creation of political systems, they had a real-world relevance. The political climate was volatile, and German thinkers were now forced to take a stand on the question of political authority. When Hegel wrote <i>Phenomenology,</i> he was aware of the need to have an independent voice in a world that was becoming dominated by ideologies. He had been viewed as a supporter of his colleague <a id=\"m-ref36\" data-score=\"8\" data-id=\"9884\" data-type=\"Person\">Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling’s</a> so-called “<a href=\"#m-gl-Identityphilosophy\" id=\"m-ref37\" data-score=\"10\">identity philosophy,”</a> a philosophical approach concerned with things such as the permanence of personal identity. But <i>Phenomenology</i> showed that Hegel had a legitimate voice of his own.<a href=\"#m-en-4\">1</a> His departure from the Kantian school was a major development in the history of philosophy—and an opportunity for academic philosophy to engage with the political world.

    "content": "Hegel was clearly influenced by the work of Kant, whose ideas about a universal “<a href=\"#m-gl-Invisiblechurch\" id=\"m-ref38\" data-score=\"10\">invisible church”</a>—invisible because it was internal and founded on pure reason—are easy to see in <i>Phenomenology</i>. It was a concept with practical and political implications. The “invisible church” provided philosophical reasons to oppose orthodoxy, hierarchy, and the <a href=\"#m-gl-Patrician\" id=\"m-ref39\" data-score=\"10\">patrician</a> politics (rule by a group of families) of the <a href=\"#m-gl-HolyRomanEmpire\" id=\"m-ref40\" data-score=\"10\">Holy Roman Empire,</a> a group of territories in central Europe. Hegel believed that modernity (the modern era, often assumed to have begun in the late fifteenth century) was essentially different from the ancient world. Modernity possessed distinct values based upon individual freedom and modern citizens needed to appreciate the nature of these values and the reasons for their existence.Although Hegel found Kant’s emphasis on individual <a id=\"m-ref41\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1024\" data-type=\"Term\">autonomy</a>—the power to make one’s own decisions—an inspiring challenge to traditional authority, Hegel’s ideas of collective consciousness somewhat diluted the power of that autonomy. Similarly, Hegel found Kant’s supposed demolition of <a href=\"#m-gl-Naturaltheology\" id=\"m-ref42\" data-score=\"10\">natural theology</a>—roughly, the attempt to find religious truths from the observation of the natural world—highly inspiring. The traditional <a href=\"#m-gl-Rationalism\" id=\"m-ref43\" data-score=\"5\">rationalist</a> philosopher <a id=\"m-ref44\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"9868\" data-type=\"Person\">Moses Mendelssohn</a> (rationalism being a branch of philosophy founded on the idea that knowledge comes from reason) called Kant the “all-destroyer,” and the young minds that followed Kant were eager to build on the foundations he had torn down. Indeed, by arguing that there was no rational proof for belief in God and the soul, Kant’s work challenged the whole of traditional theology in fundamental ways. Hegel, we know, came to the conclusion that the Absolute was in the end something that could be understood. During his time studying in Tübingen he had violently disagreed with his teacher, the theologian <a id=\"m-ref45\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"9890\" data-type=\"Person\">Gottlob Storr,</a> over Kant’s idea that God and the soul were postulates <a id=\"m-ref46\" data-score=\"6\" data-id=\"1037\" data-type=\"Term\">of pure practical reason.</a> A “postulate” is a theoretical proposition intended to test an idea, so by this, Kant had meant that such things were <a href=\"#m-gl-Noumenal\" id=\"m-ref47\" data-score=\"10\">noumenal</a> (a word he used to describe unknowable things, such as the afterlife) and therefore neither provable nor disprovable.

Hegel’s <i>Phenomenology of Spirit </i>is “what really matters?” While the language used to discuss the <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref50\" data-id=\"1019\" data-type=\"Term\">Absolute</a> (for Hegel, an unchanging, independent, and ultimately unknowable truth) may be unfamiliar, Hegel’s interest in how objects <i>are</i> in fact belongs to the field of ontology, a field of inquiry that deals with the “<a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref51\" data-id=\"1041\" data-type=\"Term\">doctrine of being.”</a> He split his analysis into two parts that he named “conceptions”.The first conception tried to clarify the general concepts or <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref52\" data-id=\"1029\" data-type=\"Term\">categories</a> that can be used to decide what “exists.” The Greek philosopher <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref53\" data-id=\"9836\" data-type=\"Person\">Aristotle</a> believed that there were 10 categories; everything that existed fitted into one of them. For example, you might encounter an object and declare that it fitted into the category “substance.” For Kant this was simply a matter of judgment. For Hegel, however, <i>analyzing</i> these categories was essential. It is possible to think about the categories using simpler terms than those that Hegel or Kant provided. How can one understand a hot cup of tea? The categories of “hot,” “wet,” and “drink” tell us something. But these categories themselves also fit into more general categories: “drink,” for example, fits into the category “liquid.”The second conception tells us which things have the status of being truly real. This is asking a very simple question. Is everything about which we can have precise thoughts using categories equally real? This returns us to the earlier question: is a chair more real than an abstract concept such as a number? Hegel’s <i>Phenomenology</i> tackled this in a very specific and original way: the first concept of ontology clarified the question of <i>how things are</i>, while the second clarified the question of <i>what there is</i>.",

    "content": "In many respects, G. W. F. Hegel’s <i>Phenomenology of Spirit</i> is unique. In terms of its central claims, method, and style, and the combining of its wide and distinctive range of topics, it has no real predecessors or successors. This does not mean, however, that later philosophers did not try to develop its ideas or that its themes did not attract interest at the time.For example, Hegel’s famous discussion in <i>Phenomenology</i> of the master-slave <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref54\" data-id=\"1039\" data-type=\"Term\">dialectic</a> (a struggle between two consciousnesses, one seeking to be recognized as superior, the other not giving that recognition) had implications for a wide range of philosophical topics. Although mainly a contribution to modern theories of <a data-score=\"10\" href=\"#m-gl-Naturalrights\" id=\"m-ref55\">natural rights</a> (rights possessed by all, regardless of social or moral codes), his theory would have been seen by readers in relation to the philosopher <a data-score=\"8\" id=\"m-ref56\" data-id=\"9845\" data-type=\"Person\">Johann Gottlieb Fichte’s</a> analysis of the same issue of master and slave. Indeed, it was Fichte who introduced the idea of <a data-score=\"10\" href=\"#m-gl-Mutualrecognition\" id=\"m-ref57\">mutual recognition</a> (the part of us that wants to be recognized as a human being) to describe the basic freedoms to which rational beings are entitled and provide a justification for those freedoms.The English political philosopher <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref58\" data-id=\"9854\" data-type=\"Person\">Thomas Hobbes</a> had argued that beings with their own motivations and desires end up in conflict with each other and must make a <a data-score=\"8\" href=\"#m-gl-Socialcontracttheory\" id=\"m-ref59\">social contract</a> to have long-term relations.<a href=\"#m-en-5\">1</a> The political philosopher <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref60\" data-id=\"9864\" data-type=\"Person\">John Locke,</a> meanwhile, followed by looking at the <i>nature </i>of the individual self-consciousness to find rules of social behavior approved by God. He concluded that “personal identity is a matter of psychological continuity.”<a href=\"#m-en-6\">2</a> The French philosopher <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref61\" data-id=\"9843\" data-type=\"Person\">René Descartes</a> came to a different conclusion, saying, “man innately knows basic logical propositions.”<a href=\"#m-en-7\">3</a> All of these questions basically asked “what makes me the person that I am?” For Descartes, the answer was the soul. But for Locke, the answer was more complex. He argued that an “empty mind” was shaped by experiences that came from sensations and reflections.<a href=\"#m-en-8\">4</a> Locke’s views on consciousness predated Kant.Fichte, however, was able to draw on <a data-score=\"10\" href=\"#m-gl-Kantian\" id=\"m-ref62\">Kantian</a> arguments that explained the <i>conditions </i>of self-consciousness that Descartes and Locke took for granted. He <i>identified</i> those conditions with the kind of conflict theorized by Hobbes. In other words, the existence of human conflict is due to our sense of self. But although this manages to describe the origin of conflict, it does not explain conflict’s basic nature. This can be thought of as the “grudge” that our sense of identity has with the rest of the world. For Fichte the answer had to do with recognition; we reach the status of rational, rights-bearing, free beings when one consciousness recognizes another consciousness.",

    "content": "<i>Phenomenology</i> is often seen as the key text in which Hegel explores the idea that philosophical truth is basically developmental, and that it emerges as history progresses. This is an idea that differs from previous philosophy, but Hegel was working in a philosophical tradition. The influence of Immanuel Kant is clear in Hegel’s attempt to take Kant’s ideas on transcendental <a data-score=\"10\" href=\"#m-gl-Idealism\" id=\"m-ref63\">idealism</a> one step further. Hegel’s influences stretch back as far as the ancient Greek philosopher <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref64\" data-id=\"9874\" data-type=\"Person\">Plato</a> and included both René Descartes and the Dutch thinker <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref65\" data-id=\"9889\" data-type=\"Person\">Benedictus de Spinoza.</a> The debate at the time, however, was dominated by those thinkers who were also trying to modify or complete the works of Kant.The main reason for this interest in the Absolute was Kant’s discussion of the “unconditioned” in the section of his <i><a data-score=\"8\" id=\"m-ref66\" data-id=\"1037\" data-type=\"Term\">Critique of Pure Reason</a></i> entitled the “Transcendental <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref67\" data-id=\"1039\" data-type=\"Term\">Dialectic.”</a> There, Kant discussed absolute objects: objects that establish our <a data-score=\"5\" id=\"m-ref68\" data-id=\"1042\" data-type=\"Term\">empirical</a> knowledge (that is, our knowledge drawn from experience) and that do not themselves require grounding. Indeed the term “absolute” was common in post-Kantian Idealist philosophy. Fichte placed the “absolute I” or “ego” at the center of his philosophy. <a data-score=\"6\" id=\"m-ref69\" data-id=\"9884\" data-type=\"Person\">Schelling’s</a> philosophy of the absolute was itself an attempt to combine Fichte’s “absolute I” with Spinoza’s <a data-score=\"5\" href=\"#m-gl-Pantheism\" id=\"m-ref70\">pantheistic</a> (the belief that God and nature are one) and supposedly “absolute” view of nature.",

Hegel’s <i>Phenomenology of Spirit</i> are first, the nature and limits of human knowledge, and second, his belief that the influential philosopher Immanuel Kant’s work on <a href=\"#m-gl-Idealism\" id=\"m-ref90\" data-score=\"10\">Idealism</a> (an approach to philosophy founded on the idea that we construct “reality” in our minds) had not provided the necessary tools Kant needed to achieve his objective. His subject was the entire developmental history of Western civilization including its history, culture, morality, religion, perception, consciousness, and knowledge. In order to understand this, Hegel’s main theme needs to be separated into four <a id=\"m-ref91\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1029\" data-type=\"Term\">categories</a>: thought and meaning depend on the community; access to objects as they are “in truth” is always mediated by concepts; thought and being are identical; history is the progressive education of human beings toward freedom. Hegel was aware that his project would require a thorough understanding of the nature of the <a id=\"m-ref92\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1019\" data-type=\"Term\">Absolute</a> (and crucially how his view of it differed from other philosophers’.) He therefore begins by showing how an individual consciousness’s relation to an object requires increasingly complex conceptual frameworks until it understands that self-consciousness is essential to its knowledge. What is more, he shows that our struggle for mutual recognition is not just basic to human knowledge. It also drives the process of “reevaluating” the conceptual framework in the first place. ",

Hegel argues that it does not come from intuition or a process of reasonable contemplation (<a href=\"#m-gl-Ratiocination\" id=\"m-ref93\" data-score=\"10\">ratiocination).</a> Instead, it is created by the internal history of our attempts over time to make sense of the world. As an example, consider a baby attempting to understand what an orange is. Putting it in its mouth, the baby discovers first that the orange is too big and second that it is not very tasty. The fact that the flesh of the orange actually <i>is </i>tasty, is knowledge that is not available to the baby. This orange represents one of Hegel’s “things with many properties,” and so needs to be understood by way of his two conceptions.<a href=\"#m-en-13\">1</a> This requires the education of consciousness, a process of overcoming errors, without which progress cannot be made. Here we again encounter the master-slave <a id=\"m-ref94\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1039\" data-type=\"Term\">dialectic,</a> along with Hegel’s insistence that “self-consciousness exists in and for itself when, and by the fact that, it so exists for another.”<a href=\"#m-en-14\">2</a> Self-consciousness is created by an encounter between two beings who only realize they are self-conscious because of the encounter itself. A fight to the death will lead to what Hegel described as an “abstract negation” (failure of the process): the victor claims lordship over the defeated who, being dead, cannot recognize the master. Only if one of the two is unafraid of death can he achieve mastery. The slave now has to make things for his master. In the end he begins to see himself in those products and achieves an independent self-consciousness. The master, who now depends on the things the slave has made, has become as much a slave as the slave himself. Progress is only achieved when the master-slave relationship has been reduced. This can be understood in a simple way by looking at history as a process of stages. Greece, as a slave state, gave way to the less restrictive system of <a href=\"#m-gl-Serfdom\" id=\"m-ref95\" data-score=\"10\">serfdom.</a> This was, in turn, replaced by the citizenship of liberal democracies in which individual freedom was protected. In each case, more freedom is allotted to the “slave” and the master becomes less reliant on the slave’s products. ",

    "content": "Hegel that knew his philosophical language was challenging—full of technical and unfamiliar vocabulary—but he felt that it was needed. He believed that concepts changed their meaning in different environments. <i>Phenomenology</i> drives home this lesson, repeating the same terms throughout the work, yet subtly shifting their meanings as they appear in different contexts. While the work may appear to be an awkward attempt to glue together psychology and <a id=\"m-ref96\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1044\" data-type=\"Term\">epistemology</a> (the study of knowledge) on the one hand, and history and epistemology on the other, both these aspects combine to produce an all-encompassing vision. The key to understanding this is to recognize how the idea of <a href=\"#m-gl-Holism\" id=\"m-ref97\" data-score=\"10\">holism</a> (the conception that all parts of a system must be understood as a whole) unites Hegel’s key ideas about grasping both the structure of reality and the structure of social units. The Absolute can be understood only by seeing how individual concepts produce further concepts and how they gain their meaning through their relation to those new concepts. This should be seen as a process but not a method; it can be revealed only in practice as it is applied to any given situation. This is the essence of <a id=\"m-ref98\" data-score=\"5\" data-id=\"1039\" data-type=\"Term\">dialectical</a> thinking. When Hegel introduces the ideas of “negation” and “mediation,” he is referring to concepts producing new concepts. These two new terms refer to the complex process required to create the new concept (the negation) and its relationship to the old concept (the mediation). This is a three-stage process that was later described as a <a href=\"#m-gl-Triadicstructure\" id=\"m-ref99\" data-score=\"10\">triadic structure</a> of thesis (a thought that has proved to be unsatisfactory), antithesis (an idea that confirms our suspicion about the flaws in the thesis, but which is itself flawed) and, finally, synthesis (a new thought, which will itself be challenged). In this structure, an unstable concept first gives way to another concept. The notion that an individual can only enter into successful relations with another if the second person, too, stands in negative and mediated relations also forms the basis of Hegel’s theories of mutual recognition. Many of the topics of <i>Phenomenology</i> are about elaborating the holistic structure shared between individuals who recognize each other, and the reality of which they are a part.",

Hegel’s <i>Phenomenology of Spirit</i> include his ideas of <a href=\"#m-gl-Holism\" id=\"m-ref105\" data-score=\"7\">holism and dialectical</a> thinking. Hegel’s theory of holism, although deeply controversial, says that concepts can only be understood in terms of their relation to the whole. In short, to understand what really matters, the whole must be understood first. In <i>Phenomenology</i>, such ideas are most apparent in parts of the text that examine theology, the systematic study of scripture. This can be seen in the “Religion” section and its transition into “Absolute Knowledge.” From there, the ideas of divine-human identity are most accessible. Having understood that every stage of any given process is partial and potentially untrue, it becomes clear that a new way of thinking is needed: the dialectic. For Hegel, totality contains within itself the partial truths of prior stages that it has overcome. Dialectical thought, then, is a process; it is more than a means simply to come to a conclusion. The importance of dialectics cannot be understated, especially its impact on history. The political theorist <a id=\"m-ref106\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"9866\" data-type=\"Person\">Karl Marx,</a> for example, was deeply influenced by Hegel’s ideas and eventually added the idea of mutual recognition to his wider theories on <a id=\"m-ref107\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1030\" data-type=\"Term\">class struggle,</a> which, he theorized, would end when working people organized themselves to end their exploitation at the hands of the ruling and the business classes. This had a deep impact on the course of history.

    "content": "Dialectical thinking can be explained in terms of an automobile engine that has been spread out in parts across the ground. To understand the engine properly, one must assemble it. Each piece, when placed in the right order, gives us a partial truth about the nature of the engine and its function. Even placing it in the wrong order reveals some truth because knowledge of its incorrect position is still useful. Once fully constructed, the engine has achieved totality—and yet it still contains all of the earlier partial truths. Critically, nothing has been lost. Hegel likened this to a spiral. Think of a wheel with a mark on it where it touches the ground. When the wheel is rolled 360 degrees, it is clear that although the mark is still touching the ground, it has moved from its original position. This process is complete within separate <a id=\"m-ref111\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1029\" data-type=\"Term\">categories,</a> which for Hegel were: being, becoming, one, many, essence, existence, cause, effect, universal, mechanism, and “life.” As each process is examined and revealed to be only a partial truth, it in turn creates another category that shows more promise. This rejection of one category toward another more “refined” category is known as <i>negation.</i> The idea can easily be applied to mutual recognition. The state of mutual recognition, Hegel suggests, does not occur spontaneously between human beings. Instead, individuals must overcome social relations in which they do not recognize one another as equal authorities on truth and ethics. True self-knowledge, social stability, and a legitimate political order depend upon mutual recognition. But they result from a process in which recognition is not matched: “At first, it [the “process of recognition”] will exhibit the side of the inequality of the two, or the splitting-up of the middle term into the extremes which, as extremes, are opposed to one another, one being only <i>recognized</i>, the other only <i>recognizing</i>.”<a href=\"#m-en-15\">1</a> Mutual recognition in this sense is just the accepting and respecting of another being. Such recognition remains fundamental to human psychology; the desire for recognition is the desire for equality, as relevant to class struggle as it is to feminism, the struggle against racial inequality (or <a id=\"m-ref112\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1023\" data-type=\"Term\">apartheid)</a> or any other inequality. Throughout <i>Phenomenology</i>, Hegel shows different examples of the psychological and social harm he sees resulting from failures of recognition in different cultures and political systems. This is the harm he calls “alienation.” Meanwhile, the idea of divine-human identity saw Hegel drawing on <a href=\"#m-gl-Incarnationtheology\" id=\"m-ref113\" data-score=\"10\">Incarnation theology</a> (the study of the <a href=\"#m-gl-Incarnation\" id=\"m-ref114\" data-score=\"10\">Incarnation</a>—the Virgin Birth and human life of Jesus Christ) and <a id=\"m-ref115\" data-score=\"8\" data-id=\"9889\" data-type=\"Person\">Benedictus de Spinoza’s</a> <a href=\"#m-gl-Pantheism\" id=\"m-ref116\" data-score=\"5\">pantheistic</a> vision—his equation of God and nature. Hegel certainly identified his idea of the <a id=\"m-ref117\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1019\" data-type=\"Term\">Absolute</a> with God. As we have seen, Hegel’s Absolute is neither a static thing nor a theoretical idea. It is instead the process of developing a system for understanding reality over historical time. Hegel’s theory of divine-human identity, therefore, does not say that any given human or group is divine. He says we will find the divine in the human attempt to bring to consciousness a rational structure that includes the mind and the world. ",

For example, the Hegel commentator and philosopher <a id=\"m-ref119\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"9876\" data-type=\"Person\">Michael Quante</a> has shown interest in the chapter subsection dealing with logical and psychological laws and with phrenology (the “science” of analyzing a person’s character and potential from the bumps on their head) and <a id=\"m-ref120\" data-score=\"3\" data-id=\"1024\" data-type=\"Term\">physiognomy</a> (the “science” of reading a person’s character from their face). At first sight it seems surprising that Hegel’s mocking treatment of phrenology and physiognomy should receive such attention now. But Hegel was arguing against understanding logical phenomena in terms of their physical states. Philosophers such as Quante find his arguments useful in critiquing <a href=\"#m-gl-Reductionism\" id=\"m-ref121\" data-score=\"6\">reductionist</a> programs (that is, analytical methods based on a “reductive” over-simplification).

We should remember that Hegel’s Absolute consists of what truly or ultimately exists and that it is contained within the mind. <i>Phenomenology</i>, as an introduction to that science, both surveys and evaluates a <i>series</i> of <a href=\"#m-gl-Ontology\" id=\"m-ref79\" data-score=\"4\">ontological</a> theories (that is, theories concerned with an inquiry into the nature of being). But its real importance lies in its novel attempt to answer another traditional philosophical question, one that goes back to the seventeenth century and the French philosopher <a id=\"m-ref80\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"9843\" data-type=\"Person\">René Descartes.</a> We can think of this as the question: is ontology even possible? Or rather, is it even possible to know what is real?Hegel’s approach was novel because he addressed such doubts in a systematic way that he saw as a scientific exercise. <i>Phenomenology</i>, he noted, is a “self-completing skepticism.”<a href=\"#m-en-11\">3</a> Hegel was willing to challenge every possible skeptical doubt about how our minds might relate to what there is in truth, until there was nowhere left for the skeptic to go. At this point he believed we would end up not with empty skeptical doubt, but with real content. This content would be nothing other than knowledge of the Absolute, of what is <i>real</i>. It may seem strange that a book that covers themes as diverse as the Roman conception of a person and eighteenth-century pseudoscience addresses only one central question. Yet Hegel is clear that his main subject is <i>whether </i>and <i>how</i> we can know the Absolute, how objects are in their “actuality” or “in truth.” ",

Johann Gottlieb Fichte, for example, placed the “Absolute I” or “ego” at the center of his philosophy. Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling’s philosophy of the Absolute was itself an attempt to combine Fichte’s “Absolute I” with the Dutch philosopher <a id=\"m-ref83\" data-score=\"8\" data-id=\"9889\" data-type=\"Person\">Benedictus de Spinoza’s</a> <a href=\"#m-gl-Pantheism\" id=\"m-ref84\" data-score=\"5\">pantheistic</a> and supposedly “Absolute” view of nature. The main inspiration for the contemporary mania for the Absolute was, of course, not Hegel, but the passage of Immanuel Kant’s <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i> titled “Transcendental <a id=\"m-ref85\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1039\" data-type=\"Term\">Dialectic.”</a> However, since we can see Hegel’s arguments as they developed in texts written while he was in Jena, we can trace his original contribution to the field. Surviving notes from his lectures, letters to friends, drafts of his early “logic,” and his groundbreaking piece <i>Philosophy of Spirit</i> of 1804–5 provide direct evidence that Hegel had been developing techniques that he would later employ in <i>Phenomenology</i>. Such drafts and sketches have given rise to a scholarly debate about a so-called “Ur-Phenomenology” (an earlier version of the book). Did Hegel originally intend to write a nonhistorical psychological proof or “deduction” of his version of the Absolute, adding in historical sections later? Among those scholars who think there was an “Ur-Phenomenology,” there is also a dispute over which sections of the finished work correspond to it.<a href=\"#m-en-12\">4</a> Whatever position one takes on this, the main philosophical issue is whether Hegel’s historical and nonhistorical forms of argument stand in tension. The debate continues today. Throughout his time in Jena, Hegel’s study of thought and meaning, and indeed of philosophy’s place within a historical setting, ultimately fed into <i>Phenomenology</i>. As a result, <i>Phenomenology</i> represents the point at which the <a id=\"m-ref86\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1044\" data-type=\"Term\">epistemology</a> (the study of knowledge) and <a href=\"#m-gl-Metaphysics\" id=\"m-ref87\" data-score=\"10\">metaphysics</a> (the branch of philosophy that examines the nature of reality) of <a id=\"m-ref88\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1048\" data-type=\"Term\">German Idealism</a>—and, many argue, of Western philosophy itself—takes a fundamental turn toward the acknowledgment of history.

Hegel’s departure from Schelling can be traced to two of Hegel’s earlier works:<i> The Difference between Fichte’s and Schelling’s Systems of Philosophy</i> (1801) and <i>Faith and Knowledge </i>(1802)<i>. </i>It was, however, in <i>Phenomenology </i>that these differences were made clear and examined at length. Hegel argued that the Absolute was not a static being or principle, but was rather a process. His Absolute cannot be understood as an immediate, simple object of thought. Instead, it is a process of change and development driven by the internal principle he called “negation.” Nevertheless, there are fundamental differences between the philosophy he developed during his time in the city of Jena, including <i>Phenomenology</i>, and his mature system. His Jena philosophy emphasized the role played by human social activity in creating ways of being intelligible. But his mature system saw individual subjects swallowed up by a grand logical system in which they are just appearances.<a href=\"#m-en-21\">1</a> The German scholar <a id=\"m-ref147\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"9849\" data-type=\"Person\">Hans Friedrich Fulda,</a> among others, has pointed out that Hegel’s <i>Encyclopedia</i> contains a section entitled, “Phenomenology of Spirit,” which revises the ideas of the first four chapters of the 1807 <i>Phenomenology</i>, suggesting that Hegel had abandoned the early work.<a href=\"#m-en-22\">2</a> Not everyone agreed with this interpretation, however.

Tracing the influence of <i>Phenomenology of Spirit</i> on the evolution of philosophical debate requires careful sorting through the representations and misrepresentations of both its supporters and critics. Hegel’s great legacy has been the idea that history is essential to philosophy, and <i>Phenomenology</i> has remained the central text for those seeking to exploit this key Hegelian idea. <i>Phenomenology</i> is one of the main “game changers” not just of modern philosophy, but of Western philosophy as a whole. For many in philosophy, and especially for thinkers in the humanities, Hegel’s famous contention that philosophy is “its own time captured in thought”<a href=\"#m-en-32\">1</a> represents an intellectual point of no return. Intellectual theorizing can be understood only as it emerges from its background historical conditions, be they social, economic, or political. In terms of the text’s evolution one must be cautious.

Hegel intended his <i>Phenomenology of Spirit</i> to serve as an introduction to a system of his own called “philosophical science,” and especially to his “Science of Logic.” As such, <i>Phenomenology</i> has at least two main aims. The first is to bring the reader to see the necessity of philosophical science. Hegel wanted to show that neither everyday consciousness nor the philosophical tradition was capable of properly understanding the relationship between the mind and the world. Hegel called this the “standpoint of the <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref126\" data-id=\"1035\" data-type=\"Term\">consciousness.”</a>The second aim was to bring the reader to what he called the “standpoint of science.”<a href=\"#m-en-18\">1</a> Here, understanding will then be replaced by “reason” and the rational structure of actuality, of what exists “in truth,” can be revealed.

Nevertheless, by attaining the standpoint of science, the reader can be assured that the world is fundamentally rational. In this sense we can see that Hegel’s achievement within <i>Phenomenology</i> is necessarily limited. The text is in effect an introduction to a wider philosophical debate.<i>Phenomenology</i> therefore is a tool-set designed to equip its reader with the necessary skills to follow Hegel into later works.

The sheer complexity of the text made it inaccessible to most contemporary readers; time was needed not only to digest its content but also to allow its ideas to filter into wider circles. Divisions over its importance characterized the battles between “right” and “left” or “young” <a data-score=\"7\" href=\"#m-gl-YoungHegelianism\" id=\"m-ref129\">Hegelians</a> in the decades after his death in 1831.“Right” Hegelians saw Hegel’s later works as providing an intellectual justification for the status quo, the contemporary political and religious order. “Left” Hegelians on the other hand embraced <i>Phenomenology</i> for its stress on historical change and its critical potential. As a young man, the philosopher <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref130\" data-id=\"9866\" data-type=\"Person\">Karl Marx</a> was deeply influenced by Hegel’s <a data-score=\"5\" id=\"m-ref131\" data-id=\"1039\" data-type=\"Term\">dialectical</a> method and his emphasis on the role of labor in the development of consciousness.

This can be seen in critiques of such classics of twentieth-century liberal philosophy as <a id=\"m-ref182\" data-score=\"7\" data-id=\"9877\" data-type=\"Person\">John Rawls’s</a> <i>A Theory of Justice</i>.<a href=\"#m-en-36\">5</a> Thinkers associated with <a id=\"m-ref183\" data-score=\"5\" data-id=\"1033\" data-type=\"Term\">communitarian</a> political philosophy, such as <a id=\"m-ref184\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"9882\" data-type=\"Person\">Michael Sandel</a> and <a id=\"m-ref185\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"9894\" data-type=\"Person\">Michael Walzer,</a> challenge some of Rawls’s work, for example the idea that the main task of a political philosophy is to justify methods for distributing goods or securing a private space in which individuals can pursue their own ends. While <a id=\"m-ref186\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1033\" data-type=\"Term\">communitarianism</a> (a social philosophy emphasizing the links between individual and community) is generally thought to have its philosophical roots in the Greek philosopher <a id=\"m-ref187\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"9836\" data-type=\"Person\">Aristotle</a> and Hegel, its representatives do not necessarily work with Hegel’s actual texts. Nevertheless, critics of <a href=\"#m-gl-Liberalism\" id=\"m-ref188\" data-score=\"10\">liberalism</a> (a political philosophy founded on the importance of individual liberty) such as <a id=\"m-ref189\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"9892\" data-type=\"Person\">Charles Taylor</a> and <a id=\"m-ref190\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"9865\" data-type=\"Person\">Alasdair MacIntyre</a>, who are sympathetic toward communitarianism to some degree, are deeply involved with Hegel’s texts. MacIntyre and especially Taylor have made important contributions to our understanding of <i>Phenomenology</i>. Both are influenced by Hegel’s <a href=\"#m-gl-Historicism\" id=\"m-ref191\" data-score=\"5\">historicist</a> notion of rationality and the logic of <a id=\"m-ref192\" data-score=\"5\" data-id=\"1039\" data-type=\"Term\">dialectical</a> historical development the text proposes. MacIntyre and Taylor also emphasize the importance of rationality to communities and traditions. More recently, <a id=\"m-ref193\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"9873\" data-type=\"Person\">Robert Pippin,</a> although no critic of political liberalism, has written strong critiques of certain dominant <a href=\"#m-gl-Rawlsian\" id=\"m-ref194\" data-score=\"10\">Rawlsian</a> and Kantian trends in modern political and moral philosophy, through his sophisticated interpretation of Hegel.

    "content": "Philosophers today, lacking faith in Hegelian demands for systematic completeness or for thinking without presupposing, have distanced themselves from one of his central intentions. Anglo-American philosophy in particular is characterized by a suspicion of grand systematizing. Instead, it believes in a piecemeal approach to philosophy that deals with specific philosophical and technical problems. Only in continental Europe, perhaps thanks to the philosopher <a id=\"m-ref212\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"9852\" data-type=\"Person\">Martin Heidegger,</a> has Hegel’s systematization remained influential. Nevertheless, specific Hegelian ideas, if not their systematic ambition, continue to challenge the intellectual environment. In continental <a href=\"#m-gl-Identityphilosophy\" id=\"m-ref213\" data-score=\"6\">philosophy,</a> Hegel became a key philosophical reference point as <i>Phenomenology </i>became the key Hegelian text. This was driven by the fact that its importance for <a id=\"m-ref214\" data-score=\"7\" data-id=\"9866\" data-type=\"Person\">Karl Marx’s</a> philosophy was becoming clear. In the Anglo-American world, <i>Phenomenology </i>had to overcome two main challenges. First, Hegel’s name was synonymous with the philosophical systematizing of the past. Second, there were political reasons for avoiding Hegel. During <a href=\"#m-gl-WorldWarII\" id=\"m-ref215\" data-score=\"10\">World War II</a> and the <a id=\"m-ref216\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1032\" data-type=\"Term\">Cold War,</a> Hegel was associated respectively with German <a href=\"#m-gl-Nationalism\" id=\"m-ref217\" data-score=\"10\">nationalism</a> and with the <a href=\"#m-gl-Marxism\" id=\"m-ref218\" data-score=\"10\">Marxism</a> and communism that his work inadvertently inspired. Classic statements of political suspicion toward Hegel are found in the political theorist <a id=\"m-ref219\" data-score=\"7\" data-id=\"9840\" data-type=\"Person\">Isaiah Berlin’s</a> 1958 lecture “Two Concepts of Liberty” and the Austrian British philosopher <a id=\"m-ref220\" data-score=\"7\" data-id=\"9875\" data-type=\"Person\">Karl Popper’s</a> <i>The Open Society and its Enemies</i> of 1945.<a href=\"#m-en-38\">2</a>Regarding the first challenge, the grounds for an appreciation of Hegel’s ideas were laid by a gradual resurgence in Kantian <a href=\"#m-gl-Idealism\" id=\"m-ref221\" data-score=\"10\">idealism,</a> which, as we have seen, is a philosophy founded on the notion that reality is constructed in the mind. The work of philosophers such as <a id=\"m-ref222\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"9891\" data-type=\"Person\">Peter Strawson</a> was crucial here. Strawson used the Kantian idea of fundamental <a id=\"m-ref223\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1034\" data-type=\"Term\">conceptual schemes</a> underlying our interpretation of the world as a way to correct the prevailing <a id=\"m-ref224\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1042\" data-type=\"Term\">empiricism.</a><a href=\"#m-en-39\">3</a> Such work paved the way for the exploration of post-<a href=\"#m-gl-Kantian\" id=\"m-ref225\" data-score=\"10\">Kantian</a> idealism, especially Hegel’s, that we see today and that builds on the idea of a conceptual scheme.Regarding the second challenge, philosophers such as <a id=\"m-ref226\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"9892\" data-type=\"Person\">Charles Taylor</a> and <a id=\"m-ref227\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"9838\" data-type=\"Person\">Shlomo Avineri</a> wrote important works on Hegel in the 1970s that did much to explain the true nature of his political work. Taylor emphasized that, far from being proto-<a href=\"#m-gl-Totalitarianism\" id=\"m-ref228\" data-score=\"5\">totalitarian,</a> Hegel’s political vision was intended to preserve the rights and liberties of <a id=\"m-ref229\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1043\" data-type=\"Term\">Enlightenment</a> thought.

    "content": "A debate has arisen within the scholarly community since the early 1990s among those studying Hegel and German idealism. It is usually characterized as taking place between supporters of “metaphysical” and supporters of “non-metaphysical” interpretations of Hegel, although many of the participants would reject these labels. The non-metaphysical reading challenges the received view that Hegel is a traditional metaphysician who returns to pre-Kantian rationalism—that is, to philosophy as it was practiced in Europe prior to Kant’s <a id=\"m-ref230\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1038\" data-type=\"Term\">critique</a> of metaphysics. For supporters of the metaphysical view, Hegel belongs to a philosophical tradition for which being and reality are open to analysis by the rational intellect, a tradition whose roots go back through Leibniz all the way to Aristotle. Non-metaphysical views, such as that put forward in the American philosopher <a id=\"m-ref231\" data-score=\"7\" data-id=\"9873\" data-type=\"Person\">Robert Pippin’s</a> <i>Hegel’s Idealism: The Satisfactions of Self-Consciousness </i>(1991), take seriously Hegel’s claim to have completed Kant’s philosophical revolution.<a href=\"#m-en-41\">5</a> Hegel’s absolute idealism, so these interpreters claim, continues the workings of Kant. In other words, Hegel’s philosophy is not an uncritical inquiry into the nature of being; rather it is an exploration of the extent to which our finite minds can comprehend the universe and our experience of it. While this issue is really just a skirmish within the narrow world of Hegel studies, it has made clear the stakes involved in the heated question of contemporary philosophy’s relation to its history. Critics (for example, <a id=\"m-ref232\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"9839\" data-type=\"Person\">Frederick Beiser</a>) of the recent attempt to portray Hegel as initiating a Kantian-influenced investigation into the grounds of what we know attack interpreters such as Robert Pippin and <a id=\"m-ref233\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"9872\" data-type=\"Person\">Terry Pinkard</a> for not being faithful to Hegel’s intentions and for ignoring his wider work.<a href=\"#m-en-42\">6</a> Writers such as Beiser are motivated in part by a worry that if we read past philosophers too much in our own image and in the light of current concerns, we lose sight of the original challenges they faced and the insights they can give us.In addition, there has been a general tendency of philosophy from the English-speaking world to fall into two camps, which the American philosopher <a id=\"m-ref234\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"9879\" data-type=\"Person\">Richard Rorty</a> labeled “rational” and “historical reconstruction.” Both camps tend to exercise a kind of historical neutrality, as if the work (as the British thinker <a id=\"m-ref235\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"9881\" data-type=\"Person\">Gilbert Ryle</a> noted) had been published in last week’s philosophical journals.<a href=\"#m-en-43\">7</a>",

    "content": "Much of G. W. F. Hegel’s mature thought, particularly that published after <i>Phenomenology of Spirit</i>, receives relatively little attention. This is partly due to changes in the philosophical climate. Hegel’s <i>Science of Logic </i>(1812–16), which lays out the conceptual structure of the Absolute, seems to exist in a parallel philosophical universe to contemporary philosophy, which prefers a piecemeal approach and uses a logic developed in the early twentieth century.<a href=\"#m-en-44\">1</a> But philosophical fashion is fickle and Hegel’s speculative logic might well have an unexpected future. When it comes to the political philosophy of the “Philosophy of Right,” however, much of its content simply belongs to a bygone age. The political realities of early nineteenth-century Prussia are long gone.Few today believe that <i>Phenomenology </i>can possess the significance Hegel intended since it was supposed to be a justification for (and was governed by) his logic. Likewise, contemporary social and political realities mean that key concepts of <i>Phenomenology</i> can have at best limited application.Yet in spite of historical change and philosophical fashion,<i> Phenomenology</i> has had a remarkable ability to retain its relevance. Of course, much of its popularity in the twentieth century has been due to its connection with <a data-score=\"10\" href=\"#m-gl-Marxism\" id=\"m-ref237\">Marxism.</a> Yet the decline of Marxism has not been mirrored by a decline in interest in <i>Phenomenology</i>. Quite the opposite: philosophers are now looking back at the text with fresh eyes and not as a means simply to support the ideas of a different philosophical theory.",

    "content": "<i>Phenomenology</i> looks set to continue to be a source of insights for philosophers of all kinds. Those, for example, who believe that knowledge does not come exclusively through the senses but instead requires forms of conceptual mediation, are always going to be drawn to Hegel’s arguments. <i>Phenomenology</i> is also likely to remain the seminal text for those philosophers who see an essential connection between theory and practice, philosophical developments, and the historical time in which they emerged.Finally, however different our societies are from Hegel’s own, many philosophers still say that it is Hegel who best understands the conflicts of value that underlie the modern world. The Canadian philosopher <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref238\" data-id=\"9892\" data-type=\"Person\">Charles Taylor</a>, in his classic book <i>Hegel</i> (1975) and later in his <i>Sources of the Self </i>(1989),<a href=\"#m-en-45\">2</a> argues that we are caught between two sources of value: rational <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref239\" data-id=\"1024\" data-type=\"Term\">autonomy</a>—the idea that each individual can direct his or her own life through his or her own reason—and what Taylor called “expressive unity,” the need to see one’s self expressed in wider wholes, for example, works of art, religious practices, or the community. Suggesting one is more important than the other, as so much contemporary moral and political philosophy does, cannot do justice to the different goods essential to modern identity. Hegel, Taylor argues, has given us the most sophisticated account of this conflict and its historical sources. If we do not agree with Hegel’s solutions, we must first clarify the reasons for that disagreement and then face the problems he diagnosed ourselves.",

    "content": "<i>Phenomenology</i> is in many respects a product of its age. Although produced at a time of radical revolutions in Europe, it was nevertheless written within the context of the <a data-score=\"10\" href=\"#m-gl-HolyRomanEmpire\" id=\"m-ref240\">Holy Roman Empire,</a> a political institution founded in the Middle Ages. Hegel shared the opinion of his contemporaries that philosophy must form a system derivable from a single principle, a belief that can seem odd to contemporary minds. Yet of all the philosophical works of the period, indeed of the nineteenth century as a whole, <i>Phenomenology</i> has enjoyed the most interest and influence.Today, its ideas provide inspiration for projects not only in fields familiar to Hegel, such as the theory of knowledge, but also in areas to which he paid little attention, or that simply did not exist in his time, such as the philosophy of language. Similarly, many of the book’s key concepts, such as <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref241\" data-id=\"1020\" data-type=\"Term\">alienation</a> or <a data-score=\"10\" href=\"#m-gl-Recognition\" id=\"m-ref242\">recognition,</a> continue to be developed within political thought and social criticism. These fields are currently reexamining the contributions of <i>Phenomenology</i>, as it emerges from the Marxist context in which it has sat for most of the twentieth century.The sheer variety of topics in <i>Phenomenology</i> and its attempt to integrate them within one philosophical vision makes it a work without comparison. Hegel’s attempt to write a developmental history of Western consciousness that includes and connects its central philosophical and cultural moments has never been equaled. Its novel method of immanent critique, on the other hand, in which a position is criticized by its own internal standards and assumptions, continues to breed imitators in a variety of fields.Perhaps most important of all, <i>Phenomenology</i> is often viewed as the text in which Hegel does most to pursue the idea that sets his thought apart from previous philosophy: namely, that philosophical truth is essentially developmental and is therefore one and the same as its emergence in historical time. For contemporary Hegelians, this is a lesson that today’s philosophy would to do well to learn, even if the prospects of somebody writing a <i>Phenomenology of Spirit: Part 2</i>, extending Hegel’s text from the early nineteenth to the early twenty-first century, look dim indeed.",

    "content": "A handful of reviews of G. W. F. Hegel’s <i>Phenomenology of Spirit</i> appeared in the first few years following its publication. The reviewers were united, both in their verdict that Hegel’s style was extremely dense and obscure, and in their general misunderstanding of the book. No critical agreement was reached. Many of the book’s harsher critics were doubtless taking revenge for the scathing and frequently sarcastic reviews their books had received in the <i>Critical Journal of Philosophy; </i>they might not have been certain Hegel wrote the attacks but they certainly suspected he was involved. One of the criticisms leveled was that Hegel had simply returned to the philosophical approach of rationalism of the thinkers Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Christian Wolff, which had dominated German philosophy for most of the eighteenth century. (According to the rational approach, knowledge can only be achieved through reason.) A review from 1809 in the <i>Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung</i> (“General Literary Times”), for example, argued that Hegel had made a fundamental error pointed out by Kant: namely that we could gain definitive knowledge of objects just through using formal logic.<a href=\"#m-en-26\">1</a> Had Hegel, it asked, not understood a central point of the Kantian revolution, that our concepts have meaning only in relation to sensory experience? Other reviewers simply found it incomprehensible. A review from <i>Neue Leipzig Literaturzeitung</i> (“New Leipzig Literary Times”), for instance, failed to see how Hegel could show that the shapes of consciousness he surveyed were one-sided, suppressing aspects of their true selves theoretically opposed to their own essence.<a href=\"#m-en-27\">2</a> The reviewer, therefore, claimed that the book was littered with contradictions. He pointed to Hegel’s claim that the truth of the master’s consciousness is the slave’s. Instead of seeing how this claim pointed to the need for master and slave to recognize one another as equals, the reviewer simply took it as a contradiction.<a href=\"#m-en-28\">3</a>",

Hegel’s <i>Phenomenology of Spirit</i> have enjoyed an enduring shelf life.

    "content": "Nevertheless, Hegel’s developing conception of his own philosophy does not owe anything to contemporary critiques of <i>Phenomenology</i>. After the Napoleonic invasion of Jena the city was largely in ruins, many fled, and the university could barely function. Hegel left the city and did not become a university professor until 1816. In 1807 he went to the town of Bamberg to edit a pro-Napoleonic newspaper and in 1808 he became rector of a gymnasium (a type of secondary school) in Nuremberg. These demanding activities, following so soon after the publication of <i>Phenomenology</i>, are another reason why his philosophical development did not come from dialogue with his early critics. Much more formative was the experience of using <i>Phenomenology</i> as a text for his teaching at the gymnasium. Doing so forced him to reconsider the status of the text within his system and its adequacy as an introduction to that system. The teaching guidelines set by his friend <a id=\"m-ref162\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"9870\" data-type=\"Person\">Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer</a>—the Commissioner of Education in Bavaria—specified an “Introduction to Knowledge of the Universal Coherence of the Sciences.” From this, Hegel understood that he was to teach how the different philosophical sciences were logically interrelated. With this in mind, he produced what he called an “encyclopedia” of his emerging system as a basis for teaching. Hegel eventually integrated the first sections of <i>Phenomenology</i> into this encyclopedia, which became the basis for his mature system. The phenomenological sections established the standpoint of “universal consciousness,” which was needed for a more detailed philosophy of spirit. This philosophy would then serve as the basis for the standpoint for his logic of basic <a href=\"#m-gl-Ontology\" id=\"m-ref163\" data-score=\"4\">ontological</a> <a id=\"m-ref164\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1029\" data-type=\"Term\">categories</a> and for his “real philosophy,” that is, his <a href=\"#m-gl-Philosophyofnature\" id=\"m-ref165\" data-score=\"10\">philosophy of nature</a> and spirit. The fact that the historical sections of <i>Phenomenology</i> did not appear in their earlier form had, in fact, very little to do with criticisms the text had received. ",

    "content": "When did Aristotle compose <i>Metaphysics</i>? Scholars have debated this question extensively. Until the twentieth century, academics viewed Aristotle’s works as a consistent and finished whole—treating the entire Aristotelian corpus as the product of a mature thinker. Over the last 100 years, however, scholars have challenged this view and it is now generally rejected. <a id=\"m-ref109\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"9810\" data-type=\"Person\">Thomas Case,</a> an early twentieth-century philosopher who worked on Aristotle, argued that it would have taken Aristotle many years to produce the sheer volume of works he authored. So it remains unlikely he composed them all at the end of his life. Instead, Case argues that Aristotle kept his works as manuscripts and worked on them continuously throughout his career.<a href=\"#m-en-60\">1</a> The lack of unity among the books of <i>Metaphysics</i> also supports this interpretation. The variety of topics and their lack of coherent connections clearly indicates that Aristotle did not produce <i>Metaphysics</i> in a conventional manner—writing the entire work at once. So it may well have been composed over a longer time period. <a id=\"m-ref110\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"9807\" data-type=\"Person\">Jonathan Barnes,</a> a well-known Aristotelian scholar, has pointed out that ancient commentaries on <i>Metaphysics</i> imply that Aristotle died before editing the work properly, leaving it in an incoherent state.<a href=\"#m-en-61\">2</a> Overall, scholars tend to agree that <i>Metaphysics</i> must have been a product of continuous work throughout Aristotle’s lifetime, and that he may indeed have left it unfinished when he died. The central theme developed in <i>Metaphysics</i>, the idea of <a id=\"m-ref111\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1013\" data-type=\"Term\">substance,</a> can also be found in another of Aristotle’s works, <i>Categories</i>. Although there is no clear evidence suggesting that Aristotle wrote <i>Categories</i> before <i>Metaphysics</i>, “it is easier to understand the relation of the doctrine of substance in the <i>Categories </i>… to the doctrine and argument of <i>Metaphysics</i> 7 if we supposed that <i>Metaphysics</i> 7 is later.”<a href=\"#m-en-62\">3</a> Students often read <i>Categories</i> before <i>Metaphysics</i> as an introduction to the notion of substance, because it presents some simpler ideas. For instance, in <i>Categories</i>, Aristotle defines substance as that which is capable of receiving contraries while being numerically singular.<a href=\"#m-en-63\">4</a> To help readers understand this idea, Aristotle provided an example: because a color cannot be black and white while remaining the same color, color is not substance. But a man can be pale and become tanned while remaining the same man. So being a man is a substance. This idea shows that we ought to understand substances as explanations of what it is like to be, for instance, a man. In <i>Categories,</i> Aristotle points out that if we wish to know what the essence of being a man is, we cannot simply look at any properties that a man might have. A man can be pale or old or an Athenian citizen, but being pale, old, and an Athenian citizen do not explain what it is to be a man. For this reason, Aristotle suggests that we need to determine what the substance of man is by investigating what aspects of a man persist through all changes. ",

    "content": "The main idea Aristotle tackles in <i>Metaphysics</i> is substance. But concepts such as “potentiality” and “actuality,” as well as the nature of God, also contribute to his project of investigating “<a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref85\" data-id=\"979\" data-type=\"Term\">being qua being.”</a><a href=\"#m-en-43\">1</a> Aristotle develops his ideas of potentiality and actuality most clearly in his other work, <i>Physics</i>. He used these concepts to answer the philosophical problem of change, a question the <a data-score=\"5\" id=\"m-ref86\" data-id=\"1009\" data-type=\"Term\">pre-Socratic</a> philosopher <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref87\" data-id=\"9824\" data-type=\"Person\">Parmenides</a> had raised.In a notoriously complicated argument, Parmenides maintained that one cannot use the notion of non-being to explain being, since non-being does not exist. Ultimately, this led him to assert that change is impossible, because change involves the generation and destruction of states. “Parmenides rejected pluralism and the reality of any kind of change: for him all was one indivisible, unchanging reality, and any appearances to the contrary were illusions, to be dispelled by reason and revelation.”<a href=\"#m-en-44\">2</a>Because they did not accept the existence of non-being, both Parmenides and <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref88\" data-id=\"9825\" data-type=\"Person\">Plato</a> (especially in his middle works) were of the opinion that generation—the act of coming into being from a state of non-being—is impossible. Following that logic, since destruction requires the change from being into non-being, destruction is equally impossible.In <i>Metaphysics</i> book Theta, Aristotle offers an account of change that solves Parmenides’ puzzle by distinguishing between being-as-potentiality and being-as-actuality.<a href=\"#m-en-45\">3</a> A child, for instance, exists potentially as an adult and in actuality as a child. As Aristotle saw it, change is not a phenomenon in which non-existence comes into existence, but in which “being potentially” changes into “being actually.”",

His father, a court doctor in <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref203\" data-id=\"996\" data-type=\"Term\">Macedonia</a> (on the northern edges of Classical Greece), taught him biology and <a data-score=\"5\" id=\"m-ref204\" data-id=\"985\" data-type=\"Term\">empirical</a> studies, that is the means of gaining knowledge based on observation or experience. At the age of 17, Aristotle moved to Athens and joined the <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref205\" data-id=\"972\" data-type=\"Term\">Academy,</a> the school founded by the renowned philosopher Plato. He studied there until Plato’s death in 347 b.c.e. Plato had himself studied with the great philosopher <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref206\" data-id=\"9832\" data-type=\"Person\">Socrates,</a> which gave Aristotle access to the prime philosophical wisdom of the era.After Plato died, Aristotle returned to the Macedonian court and became the tutor of a nine-year-old boy named Alexander. The child would grow up to become one of the most powerful rulers of the ancient world: <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref207\" data-id=\"9798\" data-type=\"Person\">Alexander the Great.</a> Aristotle tutored Alexander until the boy turned 16.

He left Athens again in 322 b.c.e. and died later that year.Unfortunately, very little of Aristotle’s work survives.

The book’s title, <i>Metaphysics</i>, even gave a name to the philosophical discipline dedicated to studying the fundamental nature of being. But Aristotle died long before his editor coined the word <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref210\" data-id=\"998\" data-type=\"Term\">metaphysics,</a> and the editor may have meant it to signify nothing more than the book’s placement in Aristotle’s body of work—that it came after (the Greek word <i>meta</i>) his work entitled <i>Physics</i>.",

    "content": "For centuries before Aristotle, thinkers pursuing <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref211\" data-id=\"1003\" data-type=\"Term\">ontology</a>—the study of the nature of being—had theorized about what “being” actually is. Earlier philosophers had suggested that “<a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref212\" data-id=\"1013\" data-type=\"Term\">substance”</a>—the thing that underlies all existence—was the air. Another thought it was water. A third thought fire. Yet another decided substance was, in fact, a combination of four elements, adding “earth” to the mix. Then in the fourth century b.c.e., Aristotle’s teacher Plato changed the discussion forever when he theorized that eternal, bodiless “forms” existing independently in the world create the realities we perceive. This became known as Plato’s <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref213\" data-id=\"1015\" data-type=\"Term\">Theory of Forms.</a>Despite the fact that he had studied with Plato, Aristotle did not hesitate to disagree with his teacher’s conclusions. Abandoning the notion of bodiless (or <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref214\" data-id=\"992\" data-type=\"Term\">incorporeal)</a> forms, Aristotle suggested that form only exists when it is present in matter. He pointed out a logical inconsistency in Plato’s theory. If every object requires a form to copy so that it may come into existence, then a man must have a “form” of a man to copy. And where does that form come from? This has become known as the “<a data-score=\"7\" id=\"m-ref215\" data-id=\"1016\" data-type=\"Term\">third man”</a> argument.Aristotle primarily aims to investigate what he calls “<a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref216\" data-id=\"979\" data-type=\"Term\">being qua being”</a>—“qua” meaning “by virtue of what is.” But in the loose collection of ideas that make up <i>Metaphysics</i>, other subjects arise as well. Aristotle also tackles concepts such as “potentiality” and “<a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref217\" data-id=\"974\" data-type=\"Term\">actuality,”</a> using them to answer a philosophical question that the philosopher <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref218\" data-id=\"9824\" data-type=\"Person\">Parmenides</a> had raised over a century earlier. Essentially, Parmenides’ complex argument made the case that because there is no such thing as a state of non-being, change is essentially impossible. Aristotle disagreed with that argument by making a distinction between being-as-potential and being-as-actuality. A child exists both as a potential adult and as an actual child. In Aristotle’s view, change did not involve the transformation from a state of non-being to being but from a state of potentiality into one of actuality.Another important argument Aristotle developed in <i>Metaphysics</i> is the theory of the “<a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref219\" data-id=\"1018\" data-type=\"Term\">unmoved mover”</a>—a kind of heavenly catalyst that serves as the source of all movement in the world. Are there many unmoved movers or only one? Aristotle’s conclusions remain unclear, as he makes a case for each idea in different books in <i>Metaphysics</i>.Supporting his theories through his strong analytical skills and powers of observation, Aristotle accepted some previous scholarship while overturning long-held beliefs about the nature of existence. He also raised a host of new questions for future philosophers to deal with—part of the reason his work remained central to the discipline of philosophy for so long. Subsequent generations of philosophers would continue to debate the merits of <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref220\" data-id=\"1006\" data-type=\"Term\">Platonic</a> versus Aristotelian interpretations. In some ways, the debates inspired by Aristotle’s thought continue today. And Aristotle’s reputation as one of the founding minds of philosophy remains unquestioned.",

His work has influenced philosophers throughout the centuries—from the ancient Greeks of his day to the <a data-score=\"5\" id=\"m-ref221\" data-id=\"1011\" data-type=\"Term\">Romans,</a> to <a data-score=\"7\" id=\"m-ref222\" data-id=\"997\" data-type=\"Term\">medieval</a> philosophers in <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref223\" data-id=\"981\" data-type=\"Term\">Christian</a> and <a data-score=\"5\" id=\"m-ref224\" data-id=\"993\" data-type=\"Term\">Islamic</a> cultures, all the way to the present day. Twelfth-century Islamic philosopher Averroes (Ibn <a data-score=\"7\" id=\"m-ref225\" data-id=\"9804\" data-type=\"Person\">Rushd)</a> and Christian cleric <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref226\" data-id=\"9803\" data-type=\"Person\">Thomas Aquinas</a> in the thirteenth century both used Aristotelian concepts in their work. In the eighteenth century, Scottish philosopher <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref227\" data-id=\"9820\" data-type=\"Person\">David Hume</a>—whose philosophy held, in essence, that one cannot know anything for certain without evidence—criticized Aristotle for having drawn unsupported conclusions about substance. After Hume, Aristotle’s influence began to decline. But nevertheless, his works remained a part of the academic curriculum, as they do today.In the second half of the twentieth century, philosophers revived their interest in metaphysics. The concerns metaphysicians address today differ from those considered in Aristotle’s time, but scholars still recognize the historical and philosophical importance of his work. Some study <i>Metaphysics</i> and his other works <a data-score=\"4\" id=\"m-ref228\" data-id=\"988\" data-type=\"Term\">exegetically</a>—that is, analyzing and interpreting the text to try to get to Aristotle’s original meaning. Others look to this ancient text as a source of fresh inspiration. These scholars adapt Aristotle’s thinking to the present day and seek to expand on his insights. For instance, Aristotle’s ideas about the difference between <a data-score=\"7\" id=\"m-ref229\" data-id=\"1014\" data-type=\"Term\">substantial properties</a> and <a data-score=\"7\" id=\"m-ref230\" data-id=\"973\" data-type=\"Term\">accidental properties</a> has inspired the modern theory of <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref231\" data-id=\"987\" data-type=\"Term\">essentialism.</a> Essentialism holds that every entity has certain core attributes that constitute its identity and function. As the essentialist theory challenges Hume, in a sense we have come full circle. Hume refuted Aristotle; Aristotelian thinking refutes Hume.British philosopher Jonathan Barnes noted that “an account of Aristotle’s intellectual afterlife would be little less than a history of European thought.”<a data-id=\"823\" data-type=\"note\">1</a> As we seem to be in the midst of a revival of interest in Aristotle’s work today, that afterlife continues.",

    "content": "One of the most important works of ancient philosophy, Aristotle’s <i>Metaphysics</i> consists of 14 treatises, named after letters of the Greek alphabet, which address various metaphysical topics. In fact, the name of the philosophical subfield of <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref2\" data-id=\"998\" data-type=\"Term\">metaphysics</a> comes from the title of this book.<i>Metaphysics</i> asks the central question: what is <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref3\" data-id=\"1013\" data-type=\"Term\">substance?</a> As philosophy professor <a data-score=\"7\" id=\"m-ref4\" data-id=\"9831\" data-type=\"Person\">Christopher Shields</a> explains, in this work Aristotle argues that, “it is … possible to study all beings insofar as they are related to the core instance of being, and then also to study that core instance, namely substance.”<a href=\"#m-en-2\">1</a> Aristotle most prominently addresses the question of substance in book Zeta of <i>Metaphysics</i>. The other books contain discussions more or less pertinent to this topic as well, but they focus mostly on other issues. Examples of this are as follows:\n\t<li>The explanation and assessment of philosophical thinking in the time before the Greek philosopher <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref5\" data-id=\"9832\" data-type=\"Person\">Socrates</a> (an era known as <a data-score=\"5\" id=\"m-ref6\" data-id=\"1009\" data-type=\"Term\">pre-Socratic).</a></li>\n\t<li>A critique of the philosopher Plato’s <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref7\" data-id=\"1015\" data-type=\"Term\">Theory of Forms</a>—that non-material forms or ideas rather than the material world we know through our sensations are most fundamentally real.</li>\n\t<li>Relationships between parts and wholes—the study of parts and wholes concerns such questions as whether there are composite objects (complex objects with sub-parts) whose existence consists of more than <i>just</i> the sum of their parts.</li>\n&nbsp;Among the more famous ideas Aristotle presents in <i>Metaphysics</i> are the discussion of the nature of change and the idea that the first cause of all change in the universe is an <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref8\" data-id=\"1018\" data-type=\"Term\">unmoved mover.</a> This unmoved mover moves other things, but is not itself moved by any previous action.Aristotle’s analysis of these topics greatly influenced the debates on metaphysics in <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref9\" data-id=\"976\" data-type=\"Term\">antiquity</a> (the period before the <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref10\" data-id=\"1000\" data-type=\"Term\">Middle Ages,</a> but within the span of Western human history), the Middle Ages, and beyond, even to the present day. Anyone who wishes to study the history of philosophical thought or to investigate central metaphysical questions more generally would do well to begin with <i>Metaphysics</i>.",

He remained there until Plato’s death in 347 b.c.e.After leaving the Academy, Aristotle tutored future king and warrior <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref14\" data-id=\"9798\" data-type=\"Person\">Alexander the Great</a> in Macedonia. Returning to Athens in 335 b.c.e., he established the <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref15\" data-id=\"995\" data-type=\"Term\">Lyceum,</a> his own philosophical school, and here he wrote all his major works, including <i>Metaphysics</i>. “This second period of residency in Athens was an astonishingly productive one for Aristotle … many of the philosophical works of Aristotle that we possess today probably derive from this period.”<a href=\"#m-en-3\">2</a>As with most ancient philosophers, we know little about the details of Aristotle’s life. But the rich intellectual culture of Athens surely played a key role in the development of his thought.Athens was a significant political center. Aristotle would have been able to develop his political thoughts by watching politics firsthand. As for the study of metaphysics, Athens provided an environment in which a thinker such as Aristotle would not just be introduced to a variety of philosophical concepts, but would also observe these ideas being put to the test through philosophical debates. His education therefore meant that he became well acquainted with the ideas that he later criticized and rejected in <i>Metaphysics</i>. The most important of these was Plato’s Theory of Forms.",

As a resident alien—a “<a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref16\" data-id=\"999\" data-type=\"Term\">metic”</a> in Greek—he could not fully participate in the political life of Athens, could not own land, and had to pay higher taxes than a full citizen. We can only speculate on this, but it might have been his metic status that led him to leave Athens after Plato’s death. Scholar Jonathan Barnes describes one possible scenario: “In 347 the northern town of Olynthus has just fallen to the Macedonian army, and the anti-Macedonian party in Athens, led by the orator <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref18\" data-id=\"9812\" data-type=\"Person\">Demosthenes,</a> was in the ascendant.

Some three centuries after his death, a Roman editor named <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref24\" data-id=\"9802\" data-type=\"Person\">Andronicus</a> collected the essays that make up the book and gave them this title. Why? A common explanation is that Andronicus intended to show that this work came after Aristotle’s writing on physics. The literal meaning of the Greek phrase <i>meta ta physica</i> is “after the physics.”But thanks to Andronicus, the subfield of philosophy that Aristotle’s work spawned has been named after it. Broadly speaking, the discipline of metaphysics addresses questions about existence, reality, or being itself. Aristotle wrote, “There is a science which investigates being as being … Now this is not the same as any of the so-called special sciences; for none of these others deals generally with being as being.”<a href=\"#m-en-7\">1</a> Studying “being qua being” became a defining concept for metaphysics. It is best understood in this way: “The science is in some sense wholly general or universal, for it is contrasted with the special sciences, each of which ‘cuts off’ a portion of reality and studies it … Our science, on the other hand,—or metaphysics ... —deals with beings in general.”<a href=\"#m-en-8\">2</a> Ever since Aristotle’s time, metaphysics has referred to the study of problems concerning the fundamental existence or being, as opposed to studies dedicated to specific objects or phenomena.",

As Aristotle himself notes in book Alpha of <i>Metaphysics</i>, many Greek philosophers before him engaged in the questions of <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref25\" data-id=\"1003\" data-type=\"Term\">ontology</a>—studying the nature of being. English philosopher <a data-score=\"7\" id=\"m-ref26\" data-id=\"9822\" data-type=\"Person\">Anthony Kenny</a> notes that, “most dissertations that begin with literature searches seek to show that all work hitherto has left a gap that will now be filled by the author’s original research. Aristotle’s <i>Metaphysics</i> is no exception … The earliest philosophy, he concluded, is, on all subjects, full of babble, since in its beginnings it is but an infant.”<a href=\"#m-en-9\">3</a>Most of the thinkers Aristotle counts as his predecessors were pre-Socratic philosophers. An especially important group of pre-Socratics was the <a data-score=\"7\" id=\"m-ref27\" data-id=\"1001\" data-type=\"Term\">Milesian</a> school, which took its name from Miletus, the town where it originated. As one introduction to ancient philosophy says, “The first pre-Socratics, <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref28\" data-id=\"9834\" data-type=\"Person\">Thales,</a> Anaximander,* and <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref29\" data-id=\"9801\" data-type=\"Person\">Anaximenes</a>—from Miletus in Asia Minor—were concerned to provide <a data-score=\"5\" id=\"m-ref30\" data-id=\"983\" data-type=\"Term\">cosmologies,</a> reasoned accounts of the world we live in. As Aristotle acutely saw, they focused on what he called the material cause—the question of what our world is composed of.”<a href=\"#m-en-10\">4</a>Aristotle found the scope of the ideas put forward by Milesians to be limited. But he did not always criticize them. He was positively impressed by other pre-Socratics such as <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref31\" data-id=\"9813\" data-type=\"Person\">Empedocles.</a> “Aristotle praised him for realizing that a cosmological theory must not just identify the elements of the universe, but must assign causes for the development and intermingling of the elements to make the living and inanimate compounds of the actual world.”<a href=\"#m-en-11\">5</a> Pre-Socratic ideas, therefore, provided a rich intellectual soil in which Aristotle could develop his own views.",

One of the questions on which sources disagree is the relationship between Aristotle and the previous intellectual tradition. One line of scholarship paints Aristotle as an especially arrogant person, condescending to both his contemporaries and earlier philosophers. The other line of scholarship says that Aristotle respected and cared about his friends and colleagues. Scholar <a data-score=\"7\" id=\"m-ref32\" data-id=\"9831\" data-type=\"Person\">Christopher Shields</a> concludes that, “we should simply admit what is plain: the negative remarks in the ancient biographical tradition surrounding Aristotle are mainly the views of his enemies, men driven by petty jealousy and competitive zeal rather than by a sober interest in neutral assessment.”<a href=\"#m-en-12\">6</a>Aristotle’s most important influence was probably his teacher Plato. Aristotle studied in Plato’s <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref33\" data-id=\"972\" data-type=\"Term\">Academy</a> for two decades, so it stands to reason that his intellectual relationship with the elder philosopher shaped his own development.

But although we cannot say exactly how Plato influenced Aristotle, it is clear that on the whole he was a positive influence.Scholar Jonathan Barnes argued that, “there are centrally Aristotelian texts for which Plato’s views are evidently a main source of inspiration and of puzzlement (thus the last two books of the <i>Metaphysics</i> are largely moved by Platonic notions about mathematics) and—more vaguely but more importantly—whole areas of Aristotle’s philosophical interests were shaped and determined by Plato’s philosophical interests.”<a href=\"#m-en-13\">7</a>",

For example, those who believe in substance theory say the substance of a person is distinct from physical attributes, such as being pale-skinned or having a snub nose. The notion of a substance depicts the very fundamental parts of an object’s existence. Aristotle even claims that, “substance is a principle and a cause.”<a href=\"#m-en-16\">3</a>The interest in fundamental existence goes back to the early pre-Socratic thinkers such as <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref42\" data-id=\"9834\" data-type=\"Person\">Thales,</a> Anaximander,* and <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref43\" data-id=\"9801\" data-type=\"Person\">Anaximenes.</a> They discussed the principles of how the world functions. Each of the pre-Socratics had a different idea about which natural element was responsible for the reality we experience. Thales, for instance, claimed that water is the primary principle underlying all existence. Anaximenes disagreed, arguing that it was air, while Anaximander proposed the existence of <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref44\" data-id=\"977\" data-type=\"Term\">apeiron,</a> a special “limitless” element that generated the world. Later pre-Socratics continued this tradition. <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref45\" data-id=\"9818\" data-type=\"Person\">Heraclitus</a> argued that the world is governed by a principle based on rationality (<a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref46\" data-id=\"994\" data-type=\"Term\">logos),</a> which he also called fire. <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref47\" data-id=\"9813\" data-type=\"Person\">Empedocles,</a> meanwhile, was the first philosopher to introduce the theory of the four elements together (fire, water, earth, air).Discussions about ontology—the study of the nature of being—changed dramatically in the Athens of the fourth century b.c.e., when Aristotle’s teacher, Plato, introduced the notion of non-bodily forms as the causes of existence. In what are known as his middle dialogues, Plato presented the argument that <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref48\" data-id=\"992\" data-type=\"Term\">incorporeal,</a> eternal, independently existing forms account for all reality. This theory turned out to be a game changer in <a data-score=\"5\" id=\"m-ref49\" data-id=\"998\" data-type=\"Term\">metaphysical</a> debates in general, and an important innovation in debates on the nature of substance.",

    "content": "Plato’s metaphysics holds a very significant place in the history of philosophy in its own right. But it also provides an essential key to understanding Aristotle’s position. Arguably Plato’s most significant innovation was his Theory of Forms. This theory supposes that forms exist as causal entities.In simpler terms, Plato’s work makes a distinction between “being” and “becoming.” While “becoming” describes the constantly changing, perishable, and unstable actual world, the forms—referred to as “being”—always stay the “same and in the same state.”<a href=\"#m-en-17\">4</a> The forms, moreover, act as causes of properties in the world of becoming. Plato saw objects in the world of becoming as <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref50\" data-id=\"1004\" data-type=\"Term\">partaking</a> in the forms. In this way, things in the actual world represent their respective forms, while at the same time, they are also “copies” or things derived from the forms. But forms are not derived from anything else. So Plato often states that only they—the forms—belong to the reality of true being.<a href=\"#m-en-18\">5</a> A beautiful person, for instance, is beautiful by virtue of partaking in the form of beauty. This form constitutes what “beautiful” is, while the person is a kind of reflection of the form.This complex theory has many implications. As British philosopher and academic <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref51\" data-id=\"9817\" data-type=\"Person\">Verity Harte</a> explains, “Forms have a role to play in Plato’s theory of being or what there is: 1. Forms are (among the primary) beings. 2. Further … Forms are identified as having causal responsibility for things other than Forms having some of the character they do; the Form of beauty, for example, has causal responsibility for the beauty of anything else that is beautiful. In this way, Forms are not only themselves beings, they are causally responsible for at least certain other aspects of the character of the world, as well.”<a href=\"#m-en-19\">6</a> For this reason, “Forms are Plato’s substances, for everything derives its existence from Forms.”<a href=\"#m-en-20\">7</a>",

    "content": "Aristotle criticizes Plato’s ideas about substance throughout <i>Metaphysics</i>, and especially in books Zeta, Mu, and Nu. Aristotle’s critique concentrates on Plato’s idea that forms are both incorporeal (bodiless), eternal, independently existing entities and the causes of existence. According to Plato’s view, an object becomes beautiful by partaking in the form of beauty, which represents perfect beauty and the origin of all the beauty in the world. This means that properties derive from forms. Aristotle saw things differently: “If, then, we view the matter from these standpoints, it is plain that no <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref52\" data-id=\"1017\" data-type=\"Term\">universal</a> attribute is a substance, and this is plain also from the fact that no common predicate indicates a ‘this’, but rather a ‘such’. If not, many difficulties follow and especially the ‘third man.’”<a href=\"#m-en-21\">8</a> Aristotle’s <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref53\" data-id=\"1016\" data-type=\"Term\">third man argument</a> contends that if Plato’s forms cause existence, then these forms themselves need other forms in order to exist. For example, a man exists as a man by assuming the form of man. However, in order for this man’s form to exist, there must be a form of a form of man—the third man—and so on.Aristotle suggests that when discussing substances, we ought to be talking about objects themselves rather than their accidental properties. In his own theory, Aristotle discards the notion of incorporeal and eternal forms. He does use the notion of form, but in a rather different way from Plato. He writes, “by form I mean the essence of each thing and its primary substance.”<a href=\"#m-en-22\">9</a> Form, according to Aristotle, is <a data-score=\"7\" id=\"m-ref54\" data-id=\"991\" data-type=\"Term\">immanent,</a> that is, it only exists when it is present in matter. But it is important to note the formulation. Substance is “form present in matter,” but not a <i>compound</i> of form and matter. Aristotle rejects the latter option, because compounds cannot be primary.<a href=\"#m-en-23\">10</a> This philosophically rigorous and innovative idea made Aristotle one of the most important metaphysicians in the history of philosophy.",

Arguably the most important topic he addresses in this work is his theory about substance. Scholars typically explain this theory as a response to Plato. But its importance mainly lies in Aristotle’s substantial and well-argued account of substance, which scholars have recognized for centuries as a key contribution to <a id=\"m-ref61\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"998\" data-type=\"Term\">metaphysics.</a> Although Aristotle may have felt he was simply adding to a well-developed debate, his contribution is an outstanding philosophical achievement in its own right. Aristotle’s ideas challenged what had been widely accepted as a strong account of what substance is. As professor of ancient philosophy, <a id=\"m-ref62\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"9828\" data-type=\"Person\">Theodore Scaltsas</a> explains, “Aristotle insists that the <a id=\"m-ref63\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"1014\" data-type=\"Term\">substantial form</a> is not a further component part in a substance, but is of a different ontological type from the component parts. In doing so Aristotle is presenting us with his own theory, but at the same time he is offering a criticism of the <a id=\"m-ref64\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1006\" data-type=\"Term\">Platonic</a> metaphysics.”<a href=\"#m-en-25\">2</a> In addition to showing that Plato’s Theory of Forms had problematic aspects as an account of substance, Aristotle aimed to present a very different account of his own. Instead of placing substance in eternal, changeless, incorporeal objects outside of this world (as Plato had), Aristotle argued that substance is a form present in matter—an idea known as the immanence of form. Aristotle supported his argument with both strong analyses and astute observations. ",

    "content": "In his quest to define substance, Aristotle claims to be researching being. He notes that philosophers use the term “being” in a number of different ways, but then goes on to argue that primary being is the substance and then explains that when we talk about substantial being, we distinguish from merely <a id=\"m-ref65\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"973\" data-type=\"Term\">accidental properties</a> as follows: “when we say of what quality a thing is, we say that it is good or beautiful, but not that it is three cubits long or that it is a man; but when we say what it is, we do not say ‘white’ or ‘hot’ or ‘three cubits long’, but ‘man’ or ‘God.’”<a href=\"#m-en-26\">3</a>Although the underlying idea is similar to Plato’s, Aristotle presents his investigation in a very different manner. Aristotle’s thorough, methodical approach to answering very complex questions was unparalleled—both in the ancient world and afterwards. “<i>Metaphysics </i>… uses Aristotle’s most intricate and technical machinery in the service of some of the most demanding and fundamental problems in all of philosophy.”<a href=\"#m-en-27\">4</a>Because Aristotle writes in a technical style and uses many extra concepts and side-investigations to support his search for a strong account of substance,<i> Metaphysics</i> remains a notoriously difficult text to read.

    "content": "In <i>Metaphysics </i>book Theta, Aristotle uses the concepts of potentiality and actuality to explain the relationship between matter and form in their compound (or amalgamated) existence. According to him, form is actuality and matter is potentiality.<a href=\"#m-en-46\">4</a> For example, an actual block of wood has a potential existence as a statue, because a sculptor can carve it into one. Aristotle held that actuality always precedes potentiality: “one actuality always precedes another in time right back to the actuality of the eternal prime mover.”<a href=\"#m-en-47\">5</a> This leads us to the second important idea Aristotle presents in <i>Metaphysics</i>: the prime concept of the unmoved mover.In <i>Metaphysics</i> book Alpha, Aristotle states that gods are the first causes and principles.<a href=\"#m-en-48\">6</a> He elaborates on this idea in book Lambda. First, Aristotle discusses the nature of change as a kind of motion.<a href=\"#m-en-49\">7</a> Then he investigates the types of motion, so he may determine the first cause of all the motion. Aristotle concludes that, “there is, then, something which is always moved with an unceasing motion, which is motion in a circle; and this is plain not in theory only but in fact. Therefore the first heavens must be eternal. There is therefore also something which moves them. And since that which is moved and moves is intermediate, there is a mover which moves without being moved, being eternal, substance, and actuality.”<a href=\"#m-en-50\">8</a> This motion is not physical. The unmoved mover causes motion just as desired objects move those who desire them.<a href=\"#m-en-51\">9</a> Aristotle then considers whether there are many unmoved movers or only one.<a href=\"#m-en-52\">10</a> His conclusion about this remains unclear. As philosophy professor <a data-score=\"7\" id=\"m-ref89\" data-id=\"9821\" data-type=\"Person\">Terence Irwin</a> points out, in <i>Metaphysics</i> Lambda Aristotle argues that the movements of every astronomical body originate from a separate unmoved mover, but later he also states that, “the universe is unified by a single first unmoved mover.” These two claims remain difficult to reconcile.<a href=\"#m-en-53\">11</a>Aristotle’s original and innovative ideas about change and the unmoved mover solved known philosophical problems in his time.

Plato famously theorized about the existence of incorporeal <a id=\"m-ref66\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1017\" data-type=\"Term\">universal</a> entities—forms—as perfect examples of every existing object. Aristotle criticized Platonic forms, pointing out that the theory is susceptible to various objections, for instance the so-called <a id=\"m-ref67\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1016\" data-type=\"Term\">third man argument.</a> Aristotle famously argued that if a man becomes a man by <a id=\"m-ref68\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1004\" data-type=\"Term\">partaking</a> in the form of a man, then the form of a man also requires another form in order to be a form of a man, and so on.<a href=\"#m-en-29\">6</a> However, Aristotle also used the notion of “form” in his work. He argued that substance is an immanent form, that is, a form present in matter. Aristotle reinterpreted the received idea of the existence of forms and developed it into a distinct theory, “whereas for Plato it seemed vital to assert the existence of the forms apart and by themselves, at the same time as they in some mysterious way ‘entered into’ the concrete things which were called by their names, for Aristotle they were always in some physical body.”<a href=\"#m-en-30\">7</a>As we can see from his engagement with Plato, Aristotle borrowed concepts from the tradition that already existed.

    "content": "Aristotle’s surviving works remain notoriously difficult to read. In <i>Metaphysics</i>, he uses highly technical, jargon-filled language and presents his very complex ideas in terse, dense prose. One reason for this may be that he wrote these works as lecture notes for himself, and perhaps for his pupils—“the Aristotelian Corpus, as we have it, largely consists of works that appear to be closely related to Aristotle’s lectures.”<a href=\"#m-en-40\">10</a> Any student who has tried to make sense of another student’s notes can appreciate the challenge Aristotle has left us. <i>Metaphysics </i>also lacks continuous and coherent narrative—another reason readers find it difficult to understand. We can read most of its books as self-contained and independent treatises. Scholars have not clarified how—or if—Aristotle intended the topics in separate books to complement each other. But at the same time, <i>Metaphysics</i> as a whole does have <i>some</i> coherence. We may read it as a collection of different approaches exploring various questions relating to the notion of being. As <a id=\"m-ref78\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"9797\" data-type=\"Person\">John Ackrill,</a> a twentieth-century classicist and philosopher, describes it, Aristotle’s philosophy “is not a single, rigid system; nor can the treatises be set out and expounded in a simple chronological order. The real unity in his work is to be found in method, style and intellectual character, and in the pervasiveness of some terminology.”<a href=\"#m-en-41\">11</a>The terminology Aristotle uses in <i>Metaphysics</i> has played a role in the development of philosophical vocabulary. “Much of the technical vocabulary of later philosophy is derived from Latin versions of Aristotle’s metaphysical terms: for example, ‘substance’, ‘essence’, ‘quality’, ‘quantity’ and ‘category.’”<a href=\"#m-en-42\">12</a> Many, if not all, of the terms we use to describe fundamental reality today were first defined and used in <i>Metaphysics</i>. For that reason and many others, the work has an important place in the history of philosophy.",

American philosopher Jonathan Beere’s book <i>Doing and Being: An Interpretation of Aristotle’s Metaphysics Theta</i><a href=\"#m-en-55\">13</a> examines Aristotle’s use of the terms <i>energeia</i> and <i>dunamis</i> in <i>Metaphysics</i>. A simple explanation is that <i>energeia</i> is actuality and <i>dunamis</i> means potentiality. But Aristotle used these terms in very complicated ways and it is difficult to give their precise theoretical definitions. By means of careful analysis of the ways in which Aristotle uses these terms and the ways in which he describes them theoretically, Beere resolves major arguments from <i>Metaphysics</i> Theta.",

The books Beta, Gamma, Epsilon, Zeta, Eta, and Theta clearly explore ontological topics, especially the issue of existence. The rest of the books treat topics that are not obvious parts of the main discussion.Aristotle did not decide on the order of the books as we read them today. About three centuries after his death, the Roman editor <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref94\" data-id=\"9802\" data-type=\"Person\">Andronicus</a> collected Aristotle’s treatises on related topics and published them under the title of <i>Metaphysics</i>. For this reason, we cannot know what Aristotle intended his finished account to achieve. Most likely, he wanted to produce a study of the fundamental nature of everything that exists, and in doing so, to introduce and develop a thorough understanding of philosophy’s most fundamental questions, such as what a substance is, how to explain change, and how to understand first causes.The ideas in <i>Metaphysics</i> do have a certain conceptual unity. All the books contain discussions relating to <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref95\" data-id=\"998\" data-type=\"Term\">metaphysics.</a> And while Aristotle does not always link the arguments to one another explicitly, <i>Metaphysics</i> remains a compelling collection of studies on the nature of being.To the extent that Aristotle set out to provide an account of being, his work remains very successful. He not only engaged with some of the most difficult metaphysical questions, he also proposed possible answers. His strong, compelling ontological account rivals the <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref96\" data-id=\"1006\" data-type=\"Term\">Platonic</a> metaphysics of his day and has been recognized as an important contribution to metaphysics for centuries.

Some scholars used to argue that after the death of his close followers, Aristotle’s works became virtually forgotten until they were published in the <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref97\" data-id=\"1011\" data-type=\"Term\">Roman</a> period. Today scholars generally agree that Aristotle’s ideas were known throughout the <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref98\" data-id=\"989\" data-type=\"Term\">Hellenistic period</a>—the three centuries between the death of <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref99\" data-id=\"9798\" data-type=\"Person\">Alexander the Great</a> and the rise of the ancient Roman Empire.<a href=\"#m-en-58\">3</a><i>Metaphysics</i> also exerted a great influence on early <a data-score=\"5\" id=\"m-ref100\" data-id=\"993\" data-type=\"Term\">Islamic</a> philosophers. Important thinkers, such as the early twelfth-century legal scholar and philosopher Averroes (Ibn <a data-score=\"7\" id=\"m-ref101\" data-id=\"9804\" data-type=\"Person\">Rushd),</a> wrote commentaries on Aristotle’s work and used his concepts in their own works. While Aristotle and other ancient philosophers were hardly known in the early <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref102\" data-id=\"1000\" data-type=\"Term\">Middle Ages</a> (beginning in the twelfth century c.e.), Aristotle’s works gradually became more widely available in Europe. This re-emergence of Aristotle’s writings set off great interest in his thought among European thinkers.The main topic of Aristotle’s <i>Metaphysics</i>—substance—has remained a classic metaphysical notion and a central concern of metaphysics since the time he first discussed it. Philosophers in the ancient world, and those in the Middle Ages, considered <i>Metaphysics</i> a work of great importance. Aristotle’s account of substance as a form present in matter rivaled the earlier Platonic idea that substances must be <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref103\" data-id=\"992\" data-type=\"Term\">incorporeal,</a> timeless forms existing outside the tangible world. Ancient and <a data-score=\"7\" id=\"m-ref104\" data-id=\"997\" data-type=\"Term\">medieval</a> metaphysicians debated the merits of <a data-score=\"5\" id=\"m-ref105\" data-id=\"9825\" data-type=\"Person\">Plato’s</a> or Aristotle’s accounts of substance and used them as reference points to construct their own accounts.

Hume argued that because Aristotle had not based his notion of substance on any evidence, philosophers should discard it. Instead, Hume proposed a so-called <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref108\" data-id=\"980\" data-type=\"Term\">bundle theory:</a> essences of objects are nothing but the sum of all their properties.<a href=\"#m-en-59\">4</a> Aristotle believed that particular properties of a man, such as a snub nose or height, do not explain what it is to be a man. But Hume argued the opposite. This criticism did not erase Aristotle from philosophical debate completely, but it did substantially diminish his influence. More importantly, the focus of philosophical discussions began to shift. With Hume’s rejection of the very notion of substance, philosophers started investigating alternative ways of accounting for what the essence of being is. Eventually, scholars began to class Aristotle’s thought under “history of philosophy.” <i>Metaphysics</i> and his other works no longer appeared to be at the cutting edge of the discipline.",

Even among ancient philosophers who often produced large numbers of wide-ranging treatises, Aristotle’s achievement is outstanding. The range of Aristotle’s works can also be useful in helping understand some of his more complex ideas. Scholars and philosophers commonly read and cross-reference works such as <i>Physics</i>, <i>Categories,</i> (and sometimes even <i>On the Soul</i>), and <i>Metaphysics</i>. “Some of the basic concepts of the <i>Categories</i> and <i>Physics</i>—including substance, particular, <a id=\"m-ref113\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1017\" data-type=\"Term\">universal,</a> form, matter, cause and potentiality—are discussed more fully in the <i>Metaphysics</i>.”<a href=\"#m-en-65\">6</a> When looking to understand the ideas Aristotle presents in <i>Metaphysics</i>, we do well to consider the arguments and ideas in his other works that address the same or similar issues.

For instance, if we want to consider what Aristotle thought about the nature of human beings, we would find it useful to read not only <i>Metaphysics</i> or <i>On the Soul</i>, but also <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> and <i>Politics</i>.

In later <a id=\"m-ref126\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"976\" data-type=\"Term\">antiquity,</a> Aristotle’s works became a popular source for commentators such as Alexander of Aphrodisias, who explained Aristotle’s views and criticized rival philosophical accounts.

Often they studied it alongside Plato’s work. <a id=\"m-ref130\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"9816\" data-type=\"Person\">Ilsetraut Hadot,</a> a present-day scholar working on ancient philosophy, has argued that the Neoplatonic philosophers found that Plato’s and Aristotle’s works could be studied side by side. Yet, “Plato’s philosophy, by contrast with Aristotle’s, is considered the more elevated, the more theological, the more inspired. It is likewise clear that the <i>Metaphysics</i> can only be a half-stage between the studies of natural principles and natural causes, and the true theology developed by Plato in his <i>Parmenides</i>.

Plotinus employs various arguments to reject Aristotle’s idea that <a id=\"m-ref131\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"1013\" data-type=\"Term\">substance is immanent</a> form, present in matter. He also defends a <a id=\"m-ref132\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1006\" data-type=\"Term\">Platonic</a> notion of form as existing beyond the sensible world, the world we can see and feel. <a id=\"m-ref133\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"9815\" data-type=\"Person\">Lloyd Gerson,</a> a noted expert on ancient philosophy, has suggested that Plotinus identified a problem with Aristotle’s account of substance when he argued that Aristotle could not reasonably maintain that substances are immanent in an object.

    "content": "Aristotle did not have a chance to respond to contemporary critiques of <i>Metaphysics</i>, because the evidence that exists suggests that most appeared after his death. During his lifetime, Aristotle most probably engaged in many critical debates. He may even have altered his views in response to criticisms, but no evidence of this survives. This lack of evidence makes it impossible to know with absolute certainty how Aristotle might have been criticized and what effect such criticism may have had on him. After Aristotle’s death, his followers, commonly called the Peripatetics, took up the task of promoting Aristotle’s thought and responding to criticism. Peripatetic commentators such as Alexander of Aphrodisias, who wrote a commentary on <i>Metaphysics</i>, advocated Aristotle’s ideas against those of other philosophical schools such as the Stoics. Aristotle’s supporters also responded to those who explored the differences between Platonic and Aristotelian thought.However, these commentators were not necessarily responding to criticism of Aristotle. They were merely addressing alternative theories as other groups raised them. What remains of Stoic thinking, for instance, does not criticize or even mention Aristotle explicitly. But commentaries defending Aristotle against either implicit or perceived criticism allowed his thought to remain relevant long after it was published. ",

    "content": "The ideas Aristotle presented in <i>Metaphysics </i>have been widely read, discussed, and debated since antiquity. Philosophers considered <a id=\"m-ref136\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1007\" data-type=\"Term\">Platonism</a> the main rival for the philosophy Aristotle set out in the work. But even thinkers with Platonic or other philosophical leanings appreciated <i>Metaphysics</i>. The critical debate with the Platonists did not necessarily affect the work’s reception, either in Aristotle’s time or afterwards. We can best understand the rivalry between Platonism and Aristotelianism as an ongoing discussion of the advantages and shortcomings of both these schools of thought. Nobody on either side of the debate denied either theory completely. Many important thinkers have mounted interesting defenses of Aristotle-inspired metaphysics. According to the Canadian philosopher <a id=\"m-ref137\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"9823\" data-type=\"Person\">Claude Panaccio,</a> the thirteenth-century cleric <a id=\"m-ref138\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"9803\" data-type=\"Person\">Thomas Aquinas</a> “rejected Platonism for having wrongly supposed that <a id=\"m-ref139\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"1017\" data-type=\"Term\">universals</a> have to exist in a separate manner in the extra-mental world to be correctly isolated by the mind … Even though universals in the strict sense exist only in the mind for him, they nevertheless have an external foundation within the singular things: human nature is somehow in each singular human being.”<a href=\"#m-en-68\">3</a> As Panaccio’s modern analysis makes clear, Aristotelian views were talked about and discussed for many centuries after Aristotle’s death. And a lively debate still rages between thinkers who sympathize with Aristotle’s ideas and those who favor Platonic or Neoplatonic theories. Although some thinkers claimed to have definitively refuted Aristotle’s metaphysical account, later philosophers revived and defended it, allowing it to inspire new thought. ",

While Plato theorized that incorporeal, eternal forms exist as substances, Aristotle’s account suggests that substances only exist as <a data-score=\"7\" id=\"m-ref151\" data-id=\"991\" data-type=\"Term\">immanent</a> forms—that is, as forms existing in matter. Philosophers saw both accounts as important, yet they remained incompatible. This incompatibility led to a great debate among thinkers. Some chose one of the views and defended it against the other. Others chose to sidestep the problem and develop an account that approached the idea of being in an entirely different manner. As British philosopher <a data-score=\"6\" id=\"m-ref152\" data-id=\"9829\" data-type=\"Person\">David Sedley</a> notes: “<a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref153\" data-id=\"1007\" data-type=\"Term\">Platonism</a> and Aristotelianism were to become the dominant philosophies of the Western tradition from the second century a.d. at least until the end of the <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref154\" data-id=\"1010\" data-type=\"Term\">Renaissance,</a> and the legacy of both remains central to Western philosophy today.”<a href=\"#m-en-69\">1</a>Aristotle’s thought was also very important for the <a data-score=\"5\" id=\"m-ref155\" data-id=\"993\" data-type=\"Term\">Islamic</a> philosophical tradition. His metaphysics influenced such prominent thinkers as the tenth-century c.e. Persian physician Ibn Sīnā (or, in Latinate form, Avicenna). Together with other Islamic philosophers, Ibn Sīnā read <i>Metaphysics</i> as an important foundational work in <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref156\" data-id=\"1003\" data-type=\"Term\">ontology,</a> and also used Aristotelian concepts, such as substance, to develop his own original ideas. Ibn Sīnā wrote three encyclopedias. The first of these, <i>al-Shifa’</i> (<i>The Cure</i>), is “a work modelled on the corpus of the philosopher, namely, Aristotle, that covers the natural sciences, logic, mathematics, metaphysics and theology.”<a href=\"#m-en-70\">2</a>Philosophers in medieval Europe also considered <i>Metaphysics</i> a foundational text and debated the differences between Platonism and Aristotelianism and their respective views on the nature of substance. Medieval metaphysicians often adopted one of the two accounts and presented their own notions based on it. Possibly the most famous medieval philosopher influenced by Aristotle was the thirteenth-century Italian cleric Thomas Aquinas: “every part of Aquinas’ philosophy is imbued with metaphysical principles, many of which are recognizably Aristotelian. Consequently, concepts such as potentiality and <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref157\" data-id=\"974\" data-type=\"Term\">actuality,</a> matter and form, substance, essence …—all of which are fundamental in Aquinas’ metaphysics—should be considered in their original Aristotelian context.”<a href=\"#m-en-71\">3</a>Aristotle’s works—including <i>Metaphysics—</i>continue to influence philosophers today, especially those who defend a view that substances or essential properties exist that are distinct from merely <a data-score=\"7\" id=\"m-ref158\" data-id=\"973\" data-type=\"Term\">accidental properties.</a>",

His works, including <i>Metaphysics</i>, were at first read only in the school he founded. But around three centuries later, a Roman editor, <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref160\" data-id=\"9802\" data-type=\"Person\">Andronicus,</a> collected and published them. In the intervening period Aristotle received less attention than during his lifetime, but Andronicus’s publication revived interest in his thought.After Aristotle died in 322 b.c.e., his followers—the Peripatetics—kept the Lyceum going. But they saw their most important work as preserving Aristotle’s legacy and working in the tradition of his thought. As the well-known Aristotelian scholar <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref161\" data-id=\"9830\" data-type=\"Person\">Robert Sharples</a> notes, the early Peripatetics were most interested in gathering information in various fields of study and resolving theoretical difficulties. The school became less popular during the Hellenistic period, but continued until the Romans conquered <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref162\" data-id=\"978\" data-type=\"Term\">Athens</a> in the first century b.c.e.The second wave of interest in Aristotelian thought happened about 300 years later, during the <a data-score=\"6\" id=\"m-ref163\" data-id=\"1011\" data-type=\"Term\">Roman period,</a> possibly when Andronicus published Aristotle’s works. The increasing number of commentaries on his works at this time demonstrates Aristotle’s hold on a new generation of philosophers. Among those whose work survives, the best-known commentator is <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref164\" data-id=\"9799\" data-type=\"Person\">Alexander of Aphrodisias,</a> who wrote about <i>Metaphysics</i> in particular.After <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref165\" data-id=\"976\" data-type=\"Term\">antiquity,</a> the period of Western civilization before the <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref166\" data-id=\"1000\" data-type=\"Term\">Middle Ages,</a> philosophers discussed Aristotle’s ideas less frequently in the philosophical context in which he had presented them. Instead, thinkers applied the concepts that he introduced to a variety of philosophical issues. We cannot call these later thinkers Aristotle’s “followers,” but his work clearly influenced them as they developed their own views. For instance, medieval logicians (people studying or skilled in logic) applied Aristotle’s concepts of matter and form to explain syllogisms, the logical process where two general statements lead to a more particular statement.<a href=\"#m-en-72\">4</a>Irish philosopher <a data-score=\"7\" id=\"m-ref167\" data-id=\"9821\" data-type=\"Person\">Terence Irwin</a> suggests, “modern historical study of Aristotle begins in the nineteenth century. It has led to philosophical reassessment, and his works have once again become a source of philosophical insight and argument. Many of the themes of Aristotelian philosophy—the nature of substance, the relation of form to matter … —have reappeared as issues in philosophical debates, and Aristotle’s contribution to these debates has influenced the course of philosophical discussion.”<a href=\"#m-en-73\">5</a>",

It is likely to remain a very important work for philosophers and other thinkers.<i>Metaphysics</i> was an essential influence in the development of this branch of philosophy in the ancient world, as well as in <a data-score=\"7\" id=\"m-ref185\" data-id=\"997\" data-type=\"Term\">medieval</a> Western and <a data-score=\"5\" id=\"m-ref186\" data-id=\"993\" data-type=\"Term\">Islamic</a> philosophy. Most, if not all, philosophers from these traditions learned from and were inspired by Aristotle’s work. As British philosopher Jonathan Barnes put it, “an account of Aristotle’s intellectual afterlife would be little less than a history of European thought.”<a href=\"#m-en-81\">1</a>Today we seem to be in the midst of a more general revival of interest in Aristotelian philosophy. American philosopher <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref188\" data-id=\"9814\" data-type=\"Person\">Edward Feser</a> comments that, “while it would certainly be an overstatement to say that a full-scale revival of Aristotelianism is currently underway, it does seem that some of the various strands of thought alluded to are at least beginning to coalesce into something like a self-conscious movement.”<a href=\"#m-en-82\">2</a><i>Metaphysics </i>has remained at the center of scholarly attention because of its philosophical content.

Contemporary philosophers generally consider Aristotle’s main topic—<a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref189\" data-id=\"1013\" data-type=\"Term\">substance</a>—a somewhat outdated concept.Because contemporary concerns diverge from ancient ones, thinkers inspired by Aristotle’s metaphysical doctrines today do not typically use his exact arguments. Instead, they use concepts that Aristotle introduced, such as the notion of essence, being, <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref190\" data-id=\"990\" data-type=\"Term\">hylomorphism,</a> or potentiality and <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref191\" data-id=\"974\" data-type=\"Term\">actuality.</a> Reinterpreting these concepts, modern philosophers incorporate them into discussions of contemporary issues.

Believing the work occupies an important place not only in the development of metaphysics, but as a philosophical work in its own right, thinkers interested in <i>Metaphysics</i> for <a data-score=\"7\" id=\"m-ref192\" data-id=\"998\" data-type=\"Term\">exegetical</a> reasons attempt to interpret the text in a way that allows them to uncover Aristotle’s original meaning. This approach involves not only interpreting his ideas, but also investigating the circumstances surrounding the text’s composition. Scholars generally agree that Aristotle himself wrote the books of <i>Metaphysics. </i>But they disagree on whether Aristotle or later editors put them into their existing order.In contrast, historically minded interpreters generally focus on the question of how we should understand <i>Metaphysics</i>. The best examples of this approach can be found in various studies and commentaries such as scholar Jonathan Beere’s <i>Doing and Being: An Interpretation of Aristotle's Metaphysics Theta</i><a href=\"#m-en-83\">3</a> or philosopher <a data-score=\"7\" id=\"m-ref194\" data-id=\"9808\" data-type=\"Person\">David Bostock’s</a> translation and commentary on <i>Metaphysics </i>books Zeta and Eta.<a href=\"#m-en-84\">4</a>Other contemporary thinkers use the ideas presented in <i>Metaphysics </i>as inspiration for their own theories. Typically less concerned with Aristotle’s original meaning, these scholars evaluate and debate the philosophy of Aristotle’s ideas.

Cornell University Press published a new edition of the text in 2008, and the book has been translated into 24 languages and sold more than 160,000 copies—an unusually high number for an academic work.Indeed, <i>Nations and Nationalism </i>continues to receive considerable scholarly attention. Two edited volumes have recently appeared that discuss Gellner’s work on nationalism at length. <i>The State of the Nation: Ernest Gellner and the Theory of Nationalism, </i>edited by John A.

Gellner argued instead that nations and nationalism emerged in the modern era. According to Gellner, before <a id=\"m-ref262\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1491\" data-type=\"Term\">industrialization</a>—the process by which a society founded on agriculture becomes a society founded on industry, with the profound economic and cultural implications that move brings—societies were culturally differentiated from one another. Large states or empires could rule over diverse populations. It did not matter if the ruling classes spoke a different language or practiced a different religion because people adhered to local customs and traditions that could vary from one region to the next. They belonged to various kinds of groups, but not to nations. Industrialization changed that.In<i> Nations and Nationalism, </i>Gellner argues technological changes and the needs of new industries created a new workforce. To be productive, the workforce required a different set of technical skills. A broad-based education system was born to develop and perpetuate this workforce. As the organization of society required more and more people to share a standard language and culture in order to work effectively, the idea of the nation arose.Communities coalesced around a unifying culture and, according to Gellner, shared access to this unifying culture and language made a group into “a nation.” To administer and protect a national culture, language, and economy, the boundaries of a state had to match those of a culture. States do not necessarily need nations, Gellner says in the text, but nations seek their own states for protection and to perpetuate the national culture and language. From this comes nationalism: a political concept in which state and cultural boundaries match.This new way of understanding nationalism, as Gellner outlines it in the text, had important implications. First, he argues that the origins of nationalism can be found in the relationship of economy to culture. A nation is neither a fundamental aspect of the human mind nor a deeply embedded facet of human culture. Instead, nations have arisen from historical changes occurring in the modern period. Second, Gellner shows how a national education system helped create a culture connecting many individuals. In the past, groups with specialized knowledge could function as cultural units. That is, certain groups such as clerics or a financial elite were culturally distinct from the mass of the population. Industrialization changed this, requiring a universal standard of education accessible to all. Gellner refutes the idea that an elite somehow produced nationalism.",

    "content": "Nationalism is a slippery subject, something Ernest Gellner knew well. As he wrote, “The idea of a man without a nation seems to impose a … strain on the modern imagination.”<a data-id=\"546\" data-type=\"note\">1</a> In <i>Nations and Nationalism</i>, Gellner shows how the idea of a nation resulted from a certain set of circumstances. Although nations often try to assert ancient roots, Gellner demonstrates that nations are in fact products of the modern world, born of economic, social, and cultural factors—an idea that refutes many of the myths that nationalists like to tell.Gellner’s book also serves as a reminder that there is nothing “natural” about the nation state. The political legitimacy of the nation state has evolved throughout modern history. <i>Nations and Nationalism </i>asks its readers to consider what is true and what is false in the construction of a collective world of nation states.The importance of <i>Nations and Nationalism </i>lies in its documentation of how the nation state came into existence. The text also shows why this concept came to structure human organization and international relations. To understand the history of the modern world, one must understand how the nation originated. More than that, one must understand how nations came to legitimize states. In the past, a right to rule might come from conquest or marriage. Now a state gains and retains legitimacy by protecting the rights of a nation.More than 30 years after <i>Nations and Nationalism</i> first appeared, the concepts it addresses continue to be important—especially in analyzing the power of nationalism and the origin of nations. Cornell University Press republished the book in 2008 and The <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> named it one of the 100 most influential books since the end of World War II.",

    "content": "Ernest Gellner’s <i>Nations and Nationalism</i>, published in 1983, set forth a deceptively simple idea: nations are a product of the modern world. The nationalist who attributes the origins of the nation to an ancient battle creates a myth to justify the nation’s existence. We can trace the real existence and origin of any nation, Gellner argues, to the shift from an <a id=\"m-ref6\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1458\" data-type=\"Term\">agrarian society</a>—a society with an economy based on farming—to a modern, <a id=\"m-ref7\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1489\" data-type=\"Term\">industrial society.</a>In arguing this point in the book, Gellner does not just shift the focus of studies on nationalism. He opens the door to a completely new way of thinking about and researching nationalism. Rather than seeking the origins of the nation in the thoughts of nationalists or in a fundamental aspect of humanness, Gellner shows how the idea of nation connected to the needs of industrial society. According to him, changes in human social organization brought about the idea of nation. Gellner also provides ideas and analytical tools for understanding why nations formed in different places, at different times, and in different ways.<i>Nations and Nationalism </i>created a framework for thinking about and studying nationalism. Scholars today who work on nationalism or related topics will want to explore and expand on Gellner’s ideas—whether they agree or disagree with them. ",

    "content": "One might argue that World War II, which forced Gellner to leave his homeland, changed his scholarly trajectory. He moved away from his early philosophical studies and toward sociology and anthropology. From the 1950s until the time of his death, the main subject underlying his work focused on sociological structures and ways of living in the <a id=\"m-ref15\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1500\" data-type=\"Term\">modern world.</a> Questions on such topics led Gellner to his study of the origins and functions of nationalism. His 1964 book, <i>Thought and Change</i>, tackled the concept of nationalism, but people outside scholarly circles paid it little attention. Nationalist movements and far-right parties had been discredited as a result of the war. Moreover, the real concern in the immediate decades following World War II was the <a id=\"m-ref16\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1473\" data-type=\"Term\">Cold War</a>—the growing political and cultural struggle between <a id=\"m-ref17\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"1475\" data-type=\"Term\">communist</a> states and <a id=\"m-ref18\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"1496\" data-type=\"Term\">liberal democracies.</a> This tension simmered until 1991.In the 1970s, however, a new wave of nationalist sentiment emerged in Europe. As republicans in Northern Ireland sought independence from Great Britain, Ulster <a id=\"m-ref19\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1504\" data-type=\"Term\">Nationalism</a> was reborn. At the same time, a number of protest movements occurred involving nationalists from the <a id=\"m-ref20\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1463\" data-type=\"Term\">Basque</a> and <a id=\"m-ref21\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1468\" data-type=\"Term\">Catalan</a> regions of northern Spain. The 1970s also saw the rise of a number of far-right political movements throughout Western Europe. In France, a new political party led by Jean-<a id=\"m-ref22\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"10182\" data-type=\"Person\">Marie Le Pen</a> called the “National Front” exploded onto the political scene, proclaiming that <a id=\"m-ref23\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1503\" data-type=\"Term\">Muslim</a> immigration threatened French identity. Such political struggles over the idea of nation provided the background for a major rethinking of nationalism in academic circles. Ernest Gellner played a significant role in this movement.<i></i>",

    "content": "Ernest Gellner’s <i>Nations and Nationalism</i> was published in 1983 as part of a series entitled “Perspectives on the Past,” which sought to “discuss problems simply as problems, and not as ‘history’ or ‘politics’ or ‘economics.’”<a href=\"#m-en-3\">1</a> Gellner’s book is purposefully interdisciplinary. He worked with evidence and ideas emanating from several social-science disciplines, including <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref26\" data-id=\"1525\" data-type=\"Term\">sociology</a> (the study of social behavior), <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref27\" data-id=\"1485\" data-type=\"Term\">history,</a> <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref28\" data-id=\"1509\" data-type=\"Term\">philosophy,</a> and social <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref29\" data-id=\"1461\" data-type=\"Term\">anthropology</a>—a subfield of anthropology (the study of human beings) that sees human behavior as embedded in social and historical contexts.That said, Gellner’s approach is most informed by ideas within sociology and social anthropology. The academic discipline of sociology coalesced at the turn of the twentieth century under the influence of three different thinkers: the German economist and social theorist <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref30\" data-id=\"10189\" data-type=\"Person\">Karl Marx,</a> the French sociologist <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref31\" data-id=\"10165\" data-type=\"Person\">Emile Durkheim,</a> and the German sociologist <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref32\" data-id=\"10202\" data-type=\"Person\">Max Weber.</a> One thing these thinkers had in common is the idea that we can understand human societies by rationally examining certain structures, collective behaviors, or common actions.The academic discipline of sociology differed from scientific examination of human biology, as well as from psychology’s interpretations of individual human consciousness. Unlike these disciplines, sociology pursues knowledge about broad human social phenomena, usually on a <a data-score=\"5\" id=\"m-ref33\" data-id=\"1519\" data-type=\"Term\">quantitative</a> basis—that is, by measuring data.Anthropology emerged in the late nineteenth century from practices of natural <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref34\" data-id=\"1485\" data-type=\"Term\">history</a>—the study of plants and animals in their environment. European scholars used anthropology as a way to describe faraway, usually colonized, lands and peoples to other Europeans.Social anthropology combines features of both sociology and anthropology. Like sociology, it focuses on social phenomena such as customs, political organization, family and gender relations, and religion. But it emphasizes qualitative methods—the study of something’s qualities—and smaller-scale studies.Social anthropologists conduct extensive field studies and observations. Like their colleagues in the field of anthropology, they learn native languages and live among their research subjects. In the early twentieth century, historically oriented studies gave way to an emphasis on analyzing contemporary ways of living. Scholars of social anthropology use long-term <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref35\" data-id=\"1482\" data-type=\"Term\">ethnographic fieldwork</a>—observation conducted in a specific setting—to describe how people live today.",

The text reflects the influence of the philosophy of <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref37\" data-id=\"1513\" data-type=\"Term\">positivism,</a> which dominated sociology after <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref38\" data-id=\"1532\" data-type=\"Term\">World War II,</a><a href=\"#m-en-4\">2</a> and emphasized the importance that an assertion should be logically or scientifically proven.Positivism emerged from the writings of the nineteenth-century French thinkers <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref39\" data-id=\"10162\" data-type=\"Person\">Auguste Comte</a> and Emile Durkheim. In the mid-nineteenth century, Comte laid the groundwork for the academic discipline that would become sociology. Durkheim, born the year after Comte died, is generally considered one of the primary founders of the discipline.Durkheim explained his positivist approach in his 1894 book, <i>The Rules of Sociological Method</i>. He hypothesized that observation and measurement could reveal certain “social facts.”<a href=\"#m-en-5\">3</a> A social fact operated in “general over the whole of a given society whilst having an existence of its own, independent of its individual manifestations.”<a href=\"#m-en-6\">4</a> Gellner’s investigation of nationalism relies on this insight and method. His text seeks to explain nationalism as more than simply an intellectual exercise. He sees it as a structuring factor in <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref40\" data-id=\"1499\" data-type=\"Term\">modern society.</a>Another approach at the time came from the Polish anthropologist <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref41\" data-id=\"10187\" data-type=\"Person\">Bronisław Malinowski,</a> who loomed large within the field of social anthropology—especially the <a data-score=\"6\" id=\"m-ref42\" data-id=\"1465\" data-type=\"Term\">British School,</a> with its emphasis on long-term observation.Scholars consider Malinowski the founder of the <a data-score=\"6\" id=\"m-ref43\" data-id=\"1483\" data-type=\"Term\">functionalist</a> school of anthropology, which theorizes that human beings establish particular institutional mechanisms to satisfy physiological needs<a href=\"#m-en-7\">5</a>—and that we may see cultural practices and attitudes as adaptations to meet these needs. Functionalism in the British school of anthropology was a reaction to the natural history mode of earlier anthropological studies. Those earlier anthropologists saw cultural traits as indications of historical change rather than as being useful in the present.<a href=\"#m-en-8\">6</a>As part of his functionalist approach, Malinowski claimed that we cannot separate our views of history from the contemporary needs of those attempting to recreate the past. For Malinowski, anthropology aimed to understand why that view existed for a particular individual. In essence, he wanted to “grasp the native’s point of view.”<a href=\"#m-en-9\">7</a>",

    "content": "Malinowski’s ideas in social anthropology significantly influenced Gellner’s understanding of nationalism as a modern phenomenon, For Gellner, Malinowski’s ideas helped explain why nationalists project and even invent an ancient history for their nation.Within sociology, Gellner’s positivist approach—his emphasis on logically and scientifically proving assumptions—relates back to Durkheim. In addition, his account of modern society relies on the thought of the German sociologist Max Weber. Weber used the term “disenchantment” to describe features of modern society such as bureaucracy and secularization. He also applied it to knowledge of the world derived from science as opposed to religious belief.<a href=\"#m-en-10\">8</a> Weber argued that <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref44\" data-id=\"1501\" data-type=\"Term\">modernity</a> had ushered in an age of disenchantment, and Gellner found that particularly convincing. More specifically, Gellner appropriated Weber’s notion of disenchantment when explaining the difference between industrial and pre-industrial societies.The French sociologist and <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref45\" data-id=\"1473\" data-type=\"Term\">Cold War</a> liberal intellectual <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref46\" data-id=\"10156\" data-type=\"Person\">Raymond Aron</a> also significantly influenced Gellner.

In particular, Aron’s account of <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref48\" data-id=\"1491\" data-type=\"Term\">industrialization</a> specifically influenced Gellner’s thinking.Aron described contemporary economic growth and compared the development of different societies by analyzing a set of hierarchies and national rivalries. He also described the political forms that various societies take: state <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref49\" data-id=\"1524\" data-type=\"Term\">socialism</a> (a system in which, for example, industry is not held in private hands), dictatorial regimes (such as that of <a data-score=\"5\" id=\"m-ref50\" data-id=\"1506\" data-type=\"Term\">Nazi</a> Germany), and liberal democracies (such as those of America and Western Europe, for example).<a href=\"#m-en-11\">9</a> By charting the effects of industrialization, Aron provided fertile ground for Gellner’s own analyses.",

    "content": "Nationalism emerged as a topic of study long before Ernest Gellner wrote <i>Nations and Nationalism</i> in 1983. <a id=\"m-ref54\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1532\" data-type=\"Term\">World War I</a> was set in motion in 1914 by a nationalist act, a <a id=\"m-ref55\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1521\" data-type=\"Term\">Slav</a> nationalist’s assassination of Austrian Archduke <a id=\"m-ref56\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"10166\" data-type=\"Person\">Franz Ferdinand.</a> When the war ended four years later, the Versailles peace negotiations created new “nation states” based on the idea of “self-determination,” as championed by US President <a id=\"m-ref57\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"10203\" data-type=\"Person\">Woodrow Wilson.</a> Wilson based his concept of “self-determination” on the idea that national groups should have the right to found a state and govern themselves. The doctrine raised the hopes of groups around the world that they would be able to create their own internationally recognized states. Clearly, nationalism had reached a new level of political legitimacy. So historians and other scholars set about trying to answer a core question: where did nationalism come from?In the 1920s and 1930s, scholars began to answer that question. The American <a id=\"m-ref58\" data-score=\"8\" data-id=\"10173\" data-type=\"Person\">Carlton Hayes</a> and the Prague-born scholar <a id=\"m-ref59\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"10181\" data-type=\"Person\">Hans Kohn</a> were among the most prominent. Both Hayes and Kohn explained nationalism as an ideology—a system of beliefs founded on a desire that a particular world view should be instituted. For Hayes, nationalism was the product of other ideologies such as <a id=\"m-ref60\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1497\" data-type=\"Term\">liberalism</a>—a belief emphasizing individual liberty—and <a id=\"m-ref61\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1488\" data-type=\"Term\">imperialism</a><a href=\"#m-en-12\">1</a>—the political doctrine of empire building and the dominance of subject people. Kohn, on the other hand, viewed it as a product of certain types of political regimes. Different regimes produced certain types of nationalisms. Kohn divided these into a “Western” liberal and democratic nationalism, and an Eastern nationalism that was “irrational and pre-enlightened.”<a href=\"#m-en-13\">2</a> Still, nationalism in his studies was “either reduced to a function of something else (other ideologies, the nation) or … as an incredibly powerful idea that can shape the world in its image.”<a href=\"#m-en-14\">3</a>Another set of scholars of the early twentieth century saw nationalism as grounded in popular political participation enabled by a common language. Leftist intellectuals and politicians such as the Austrian thinker and government minister <a id=\"m-ref62\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"10158\" data-type=\"Person\">Otto Bauer</a> and the statesman <a id=\"m-ref63\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"10195\" data-type=\"Person\">Karl Renner</a> suggested that nationalism had its roots in language and communication.<a href=\"#m-en-15\">4</a> Their ideas, although not as influential in shaping leftist politics, had a longer-lasting impact within the academic world.",

After the war ended, the central question animating scholars remained very much the same as it had been at the end of World War I: what are the origins of nationalism? But there was another question, too: what factors made nationalism such a powerful force in shaping international politics and history? Gellner brought many of the techniques and insights of <a id=\"m-ref65\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1525\" data-type=\"Term\">sociology</a> and social <a id=\"m-ref66\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1461\" data-type=\"Term\">anthropology</a> to his attempts to answer these questions. But he was hardly the only person addressing them. In 1953, Gellner’s fellow social scientist from Prague, <a id=\"m-ref67\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"10164\" data-type=\"Person\">Karl Deutsch,</a> published a book called <i>Nationalism and Social Communication: An Inquiry into the Foundations of Nationality</i>. Deutsch’s work built on some of the ideas set forth by Otto Bauer.<a href=\"#m-en-16\">5</a> Deutsch collected <a id=\"m-ref68\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"1519\" data-type=\"Term\">quantitative</a> data—that is, measureable data such as statistics—to show how “social communication” affected groups. Good communication between groups helped build affinities, while communication difficulties could present barriers. Some scholars of nationalism, such as the American historian Carlton Hayes, hesitated to embrace Deutsch’s theories. But Deutsch’s emphasis on communication played a large role in later theories of nationalism.<a href=\"#m-en-17\">6</a>Another intellectual trend sought to understand the pernicious role of nationalism in the rise and fall of <a id=\"m-ref69\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"10176\" data-type=\"Person\">Hitler’s</a> Germany. In 1960, <a id=\"m-ref70\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"10179\" data-type=\"Person\">Elie Kedourie,</a> a <a id=\"m-ref71\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"1494\" data-type=\"Term\">Jewish</a> émigré like Gellner, wrote an essay titled simply “Nationalism.” Kedourie wrote of nationalism as a peculiarly European ideology and problem that “had bred fanaticism and irrationalism with truly tragic and pernicious consequences for human society.”<a href=\"#m-en-18\">7</a> In his 1964 book, <i>Thought and Change</i>, Gellner resisted Kedourie’s characterization. Gellner aligned himself more with Deutsch. He suggested that education, culture, and a shared language were far more important to the power of nationalism than “ideological aberration” or “emotional excess.”<a href=\"#m-en-19\">8</a>",

    "content": "In the early 1980s, when Gellner published <i>Nations and Nationalism</i>, several other thinkers brought forward ideas on the same, or a very similar, topic. The scholar most aligned with Gellner’s point of view was the British scholar <a id=\"m-ref72\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"10155\" data-type=\"Person\">Benedict Anderson.</a> Anderson published his book, <i>Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism</i>, in 1983, the same year as Gellner’s work. Like Gellner, Anderson believed that communication held the key to understanding the origins of nationalism. Anderson advanced the idea of nationalism as “an imagined community.” This community depended on a particular configuration of economic and communication technologies, as well as on the weakening of European empires. Anderson argued that the printing press and the capitalist market that engendered it led to a form of “print-<a id=\"m-ref73\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1467\" data-type=\"Term\">capitalism.”</a> This print-capitalism standardized and consolidated a given language as a consequence of the <a id=\"m-ref74\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"1467\" data-type=\"Term\">capitalist</a> market that produced it—capitalism being the dominant economic, social, and political model in the West and in many other nations in the developing world. In effect, according to Anderson, reading the same news in the same language helped bring together groups of people into an imagined national community. The early 1980s also saw the publication of a book by one of Gellner’s students, <a id=\"m-ref75\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"10197\" data-type=\"Person\">Anthony D. Smith.</a> Smith took a different view of nationalism from his mentor.<a href=\"#m-en-20\">9</a> In fact, his alternative interpretation of nationalism put him at odds with Gellner’s core thesis. Gellner viewed nations and nationalism as entirely modern phenomena. But in his book, <i>The Ethnic Origins of Nations</i>, Smith suggested that nations have pre-<a id=\"m-ref76\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"1515\" data-type=\"Term\">modern</a> origins. He argued that we can only comprehend nationalism by looking at its historical ethnic core—and that core has roots going back to long before the modern area. Smith stated, “Nationalists have a vital role to play in the construction of nations … as political archaeologists rediscovering and reinterpreting the communal past in order to regenerate the community.”<a href=\"#m-en-21\">10</a> Gellner, however, rejected Smith’s thesis on the ethnic origins of nationalism, viewing it as nothing more than myths created for modern circumstances.<a href=\"#m-en-22\">11</a>",

    "content": "In <i>Nations and Nationalism</i>, Ernest Gellner aims to prove that nationalism is a unique phenomenon of the <a id=\"m-ref80\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1500\" data-type=\"Term\">modern world</a>—that is, of the period that began roughly towards the end of the fifteenth century. Gellner argues that nationalism is an unavoidable aspect of modernity, or the modern period. It emerges when agrarian societies became industrialized. Nationalism is not, as many had believed, a primordial facet of human societies. Gellner’s contention is that <a id=\"m-ref81\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1491\" data-type=\"Term\">industrialization</a>—and the processes of <a id=\"m-ref82\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1531\" data-type=\"Term\">urbanization</a> (people moving from the countryside to the city), <a id=\"m-ref83\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1466\" data-type=\"Term\">bureaucratization</a> (the building of the procedures and institutions the modern state requires to function), and mass education—made nationalism possible.These viewpoints required Gellner to describe the process of industrialization and to outline the characteristics of agrarian societies that had not fostered nationalism. In other words, it was not enough to show how industrialization facilitated nationalism; he also had to show why nationalism could not occur within pre-industrial agrarian societies. In the text, Gellner begins with a full explanation of the social, cultural, and economic structures of agrarian societies. Then he undertakes a similar analysis of industrialization. After explaining how industrial development fosters nationalism, Gellner moves on to his broader goal: describing the idea of nation and the characteristics of nationalisms and explaining why certain nationalisms prevailed while others fizzled out. Aiming to provide a “Typology of Nationalisms,” as noted in the title of his seventh chapter, Gellner acknowledges and describes in that section how nationalisms differed, even when they emerged from similar societal circumstances and needs.",

    "content": "Gellner uses an interdisciplinary and speculative approach to the question of the origins of nationalism. He attempts to explain nationalism by placing it within a grand historical narrative. Because <i>Nations and Nationalism </i>is a short text—only about 145 pages—Gellner’s explanations seem at times schematic (simplified, or making use of diagrams). This is true in both senses of the word: he covers a great deal of history in a short span. And he uses charts and tables to describe large historical processes and societal characteristics.<a href=\"#m-en-23\">1</a> Gellner’s distinction between hunter-gatherer <a id=\"m-ref84\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"1486\" data-type=\"Term\">hunter-gatherer</a> societies, in which people survive by hunting animals and collecting wild food; agrarian societies, in which social organization is based on an agricultural economy; and industrial societies may be his most original contribution to the study of nationalism. He contends that nationalism could only have emerged in the last of these phases: <a id=\"m-ref85\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1491\" data-type=\"Term\">industrialization.</a>To make this argument, Gellner relies on the anthropologist <a id=\"m-ref86\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"10187\" data-type=\"Person\">Bronislaw Malinowski’s</a> <a id=\"m-ref87\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"1483\" data-type=\"Term\">functionalist</a> idea, according to which societies create institutions, customs, and culture to meet certain needs.<a href=\"#m-en-24\">2</a> Dividing history between agrarian and industrial societies, Gellner discusses how human societies deal with the pressures of living under particular economic, cultural, and political conditions. In his view, nationalism fulfills social needs caused by industrialization. Having established that nationalism is a key feature of the industrialized world, Gellner examines how the thesis changes our understanding of the world. Viewing nationalism in this way gives us a very different understanding of nations and nationalist movements.Underlying Gellner’s approach is the <a id=\"m-ref88\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1513\" data-type=\"Term\">positivism</a> of <a id=\"m-ref89\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1525\" data-type=\"Term\">sociology</a>—the idea that one may become certain of specific “social facts” by observing social activities. Gellner believed he could explain the historical contours of human cultures by observing how their various institutions and practices function. Gellner refused to reduce his sociological analysis of nationalism to a particular idea or value. Instead, in <i>Nations and Nationalism</i>, he stresses the deep structural issues involved in society’s transition from agrarian to industrial practices. In the last part of the book, he examines the uneven development of these changing societies.",

For Gellner, scholars who suggest that nationalism has pre-<a id=\"m-ref92\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"1515\" data-type=\"Term\">modern</a> origins—as his student <a id=\"m-ref93\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"10197\" data-type=\"Person\">Anthony D.

Nationalist identities are generally invested in the idea that there is something natural or predestined in the nation.On the other hand, Gellner agreed with the spirit—if not the mechanisms—of ideas that the Czech scholar <a id=\"m-ref94\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"10164\" data-type=\"Person\">Karl Deutsch</a> proposed. In <i>Nations and Nationalism</i>, Gellner emphasizes the relationship of nationalism to the new forms of communication required by industrial society.<a href=\"#m-en-26\">4</a> Gellner also discusses the Oxford-trained academic <a id=\"m-ref95\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"10194\" data-type=\"Person\">John Plamenatz’s</a> 1973 essay “Two Types of Nationalism.” This essay is heavily indebted to the work of the American philosopher <a id=\"m-ref96\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"10181\" data-type=\"Person\">Hans Kohn.</a> Plamenatz makes a distinction between the nationalism of the West and that of the East.

Gellner’s central thesis is that this concept of political legitimacy originates in “a deep adjustment in the relationship between polity and culture” occurring as a result of <a id=\"m-ref99\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1491\" data-type=\"Term\">industrialization.</a><a href=\"#m-en-30\">2</a> In other words, the move from an agricultural economy to an industrial economy—industrialization—transforms the organization of society and culture to the point that nationalism becomes a legitimate way of organizing political units.Gellner’s thesis relies on two interlocking interpretations of human social life. The first is the “<a id=\"m-ref100\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"1458\" data-type=\"Term\">agrarian”</a> nature of human societies during the pre-industrial age. Social organization in this phase revolves around a population primarily involved in agricultural work. The various processes that make nationalism a viable and legitimate “political principle” are not yet present.<a href=\"#m-en-31\">3</a> Gellner’s argument here relies on an idea of agrarian society as socially and culturally differentiated. By this he means that the different social strata of agrarian society remain distinct and separate.The second interpretation has to do with <a id=\"m-ref101\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1489\" data-type=\"Term\">industrial society.</a> Gellner argues that “the old stability of the social role structure” on which agrarian societies rely cannot survive industrialization. Industrialization changes human societies in several ways. First, it produces the conditions under which nationalism may become an organizing principle. Industrial societies rapidly innovate and “the persistence of occupational change itself becomes the one permanent feature of the social order.”<a href=\"#m-en-32\">4</a> This new social order in a modern, industrial society also changes human social roles and works to produce a homogenized culture and language. A sense of unity replaces the social and cultural differentiations that defined agrarian society. In agrarian societies, social loyalties are based on religion or a local potentate. But as society industrializes, it coalesces around the concept of nation.",

    "content": "Gellner theorized that pre-<a id=\"m-ref102\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"1515\" data-type=\"Term\">modern</a> societies could not support a nationalist organization. This idea depends on a concept of political and cultural difference. According to Gellner, distinctions between human groups function “horizontally.” That is, the upper classes of any given pre-modern state may be rigidly separated by culture and language from those they ruled. Examples of such “social dams, separating unequal levels” include a German-speaking Austrian elite or Turkish-speaking Ottoman elite holding sway over a Serbian- or Romanian-speaking population.<a href=\"#m-en-33\">5</a> Gellner argues, “It is clearly advantageous to stress, sharpen and accentuate the … traits of the privileged groups.”<a href=\"#m-en-34\">6</a> The upper classes emphasize their different traits, “endowing them with the aura of inevitability, permanence and naturalness.”<a href=\"#m-en-35\">7</a>In addition to these horizontal divisions, agrarian societies are also vertically differentiated. Agricultural producers are often physically isolated and “inward-turned, tied to the locality by economic need.”<a href=\"#m-en-36\">8</a> Local groups have little interest in cultural interconnection. As Gellner notes, they may “have links with a variety of religious rituals, and think in terms of caste, clan, or village (but not of nation) according to circumstance.”<a href=\"#m-en-37\">9</a> For industrialization to function properly, it requires a form of <a id=\"m-ref103\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"1477\" data-type=\"Term\">cultural homogeneity</a> supported by a state. Industrial society operates “on sustained and perpetual growth,” which requires a constant input of highly mobile and educated workers.<a href=\"#m-en-38\">10</a> To incorporate such workers into its highly specialized and ever-changing employment roles, an industrial society must produce workers with a high level of basic training. Gellner likens <a id=\"m-ref104\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1499\" data-type=\"Term\">modern society</a> to an army, which “provides a prolonged and fairly thorough training for all its recruits, insisting on certain shared qualifications.”<a href=\"#m-en-39\">11</a> One of these qualifications is the ability to communicate in technically precise and mutually intelligible language. A “large, indispensable and expensive” education system is the only viable method for achieving these shared qualifications. Education therefore becomes the most important touchstone for “employability, dignity, security and self-respect” and plays a vital role in promoting a particular “school-transmitted culture.”<a href=\"#m-en-40\">12</a> According to Gellner, culture “can no longer be a diversified, locality-tied illiterate little culture or tradition.” Instead, the education system must adopt or manufacture a great universal culture. Gellner argues that “the limits of the culture within which [men] were educated are also the limits of the world within which they can, morally and professionally, breathe.”<a href=\"#m-en-41\">13</a> Loyalty to a new, shared culture produces “the nation.” Nations form when two people “share the same culture” and “recognize certain mutual rights and duties to each other.”<a href=\"#m-en-42\">14</a>Critically—and this is most important to Gellner’s argument—the state is the only institution “strong enough to control so important and crucial a function” as sustaining the education system and defending the culture. Gellner argues, this “is the main clue to why state and culture <i>must </i>be linked” in the concept of nationalism.<a href=\"#m-en-43\">15</a> The political principle of nationalism flows from this linkage. Since the state is the only viable guarantor of education and thus culture, its borders must encompass all who adhere to the same culture. And there we have the rationale for the nation.",

Moore,</a> a specialist in medieval history, asserted that Gellner had produced an “explanation of nationalism … which makes it, for the first time, historically and humanly intelligible.”<a href=\"#m-en-44\">16</a> Gellner writes in a clear and lucid style. Not only is the book accessible, at times it is even entertaining. For example, Gellner invents a group of fictional agriculturalists known as the “Ruritanians” who inhabit the “Empire of Megalomania.” The difficulties the Ruritanians face in their attempts to join the dominant Megalomanian culture illustrate important points Gellner wishes to make about the development of the nation.<a href=\"#m-en-45\">17</a> In trying to provide a clear understanding of nationalism and its effects, Gellner relies on abstractions and hypotheticals. When discussing the problem of minority attributes within larger homogenized populations, he analyzes the hypothetical problems of a group of individuals who are “pigmentationally blue.”<a href=\"#m-en-46\">18</a> In most cases, such abstractions help show the general and widespread character and effect of nationalism within his schema.Still, Gellner’s vocabulary can be academic and his arguments, particularly those involving Western philosophy, can be quite complex. This makes the book difficult to negotiate. While college-level students may understand much of the work, they may find some of the philosophical intricacies and historical references puzzling or difficult to assess.",

    "content": "After laying out his central argument in <i>Nations and Nationalism</i>, Ernest Gellner introduces two important secondary ideas in explaining nationalism’s effects. The first has to do with the effect of industrialization in creating a society that is “random and fluid.”<a href=\"#m-en-47\">1</a> Gellner refers to this attribute as “<a id=\"m-ref110\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1523\" data-type=\"Term\">social entropy.”</a> According to this idea, <a id=\"m-ref111\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"1489\" data-type=\"Term\">industrial societies</a> move toward cultural sameness or <a id=\"m-ref112\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"1477\" data-type=\"Term\">homogeneity,</a> but as they do so, certain human traits prove “entropy-resistant.” These are traits that, in a fluid and changing society, cannot become “evenly dispersed.”<a href=\"#m-en-48\">2</a> According to Gellner, an entropy-resistant trait “creates fissures, sometimes veritable chasms, in the industrial societies in which it occurs.”<a href=\"#m-en-49\">3</a>Gellner suggests this idea to try to differentiate between two stages of nation making. In early industrialization, the “life chances of the well-off and the starving poor” differ widely. Certain traits of the disadvantaged group could be “entropy-resistant” and thus politically activated. That is, traits not evenly dispersed in society can over time become markers of a certain political status, economic position, or other difference. If so, Gellner argues that individuals may “identify themselves and each other culturally, ‘ethnically,’” and a new nation may be born.<a href=\"#m-en-50\">4</a> In the later stages of industrialization, Gellner argues, something different happens: “entropy-resistant” traits that lead to problems of “mobility and equality” will create “national” struggles.<a href=\"#m-en-51\">5</a> Gellner extends the concept of how nationalisms differ by introducing three other variables: power, education, and culture. According to Gellner, “<a id=\"m-ref113\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"1499\" data-type=\"Term\">Modern societies</a> are always and inevitably centralized, in the sense that the maintenance of order is the task of one agency or group of agencies.”<a href=\"#m-en-52\">6</a> Political power in modern societies is thus the domain of a few. Not all members of society can exert power over all other members. People do not always have equal access to education and thus to the national culture. Gellner uses these three variables in a model that shows how only in certain cases will differences result in a national struggle, as opposed to another kind.<a href=\"#m-en-53\">7</a> ",

    "content": "Gellner’s book offers a well-argued theory of nationalism that may broadly apply to different places and times. Indeed, within a text that runs to fewer than 150 pages, Gellner manages to touch on a remarkable number of subjects. One of Gellner’s students noted that he makes “varied staccato comments on multiple issues—the struggles of states over peoples, the reasons for the unlikelihood that <a data-score=\"7\" id=\"m-ref133\" data-id=\"1462\" data-type=\"Term\">Arab nationalism’s</a> defeat would be reversed, the behavior of empires, the mythical character of much nationalist <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref134\" data-id=\"1487\" data-type=\"Term\">ideology.</a>”<a href=\"#m-en-80\">14</a>Gellner’s wide-ranging commentary suggests he wanted his work to address many concerns. Cornell University Press published a second edition of <i>Nations and Nationalism </i>in 2008, clearly indicating that the book remains relevant almost two decades after its initial publication.Still, several scholars criticized <i>Nations and Nationalism</i>. They saw it as relying too heavily on European history, particularly in its discussion of the development of human societies and its <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref135\" data-id=\"1529\" data-type=\"Term\">typology</a> of nationalisms.

    "content": "Nationalisms exhibit different characteristics. But Gellner tries to show that they are all fundamentally shaped by <a id=\"m-ref114\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1476\" data-type=\"Term\">cultural differentiation.</a><a href=\"#m-en-54\">8</a> This cultural differentiation may be driven by what he terms “entropy-resistant” traits. Culture is the critical variable in Gellner’s <a id=\"m-ref115\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1529\" data-type=\"Term\">typology.</a> In Gellner’s model, while societies may have inequalities in power and education, a national distinction only arises in the face of a cultural difference. For instance, in a society “where a politically weak subgroup is economically or educationally privileged” but shares the same culture as the rest of the society, political conflict may indeed arise—but it will not be due to nationalism. According to Gellner’s scheme, “nationalism is about entry to, participation in, identification with, a literate high culture which is co-extensive with an entire political unit and its total population.”<a href=\"#m-en-55\">9</a> A nationalist group will not arise from a previous, larger political unit unless a politically weak group is also cut off from the culture of the powerful. This group may go about identifying and creating its own culture. Using the principle of nationalism, that group may act to create its own state. Nationalism can also arise when the powerful and powerless share the same culture but are separated into different states. “Unificatory nationalism” may then occur when elements in the different states agitate to unify, becoming part of a single political unit.Gellner identifies a final form of nationalism: “<a id=\"m-ref116\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1480\" data-type=\"Term\">diaspora</a> nationalism.” In this case, a subset of the powerless has both economic and educational opportunity, but it differs culturally from the majority. This can happen in societies where “positions, often too dangerous to be given to locals or full citizens [are] consequently reserved for foreigners.”<a href=\"#m-en-56\">10</a> Gellner provides the example of palace guards or “the providers of financial services.”<a href=\"#m-en-57\">11</a> With the coming of a “mobile, anonymous, centralized mass society,” Gellner argues these services can “hardly be reserved for a minority,” and so “the specialized minority groups lose their disabilities [i.e. foreignness], but <i>also</i> alas their monopoly and their protection.”<a href=\"#m-en-58\">12</a> This leaves the minority group with two choices. It can assimilate to the dominant culture, or it can “create a state of its own, as the new protector of a now un-specialized, generic, newly national culture.”<a href=\"#m-en-59\">13</a> Gellner offers the “famous and dramatic case” of Israel as an example of “a successful diaspora nationalism.”<a href=\"#m-en-60\">14</a>",

But in the Industrial Age, Gellner believed that they become secularized, part of a mass national culture.<a href=\"#m-en-61\">15</a> He argues that religion must “throw off its erstwhile legitimating doctrine … to become the pervasive and universal culture.”<a href=\"#m-en-62\">16</a> Gellner believed that Islam had particular characteristics that allowed it “to survive in the modern world better than do doctrinally more luxuriant faiths.”<a href=\"#m-en-63\">17</a> He saw Islam as being without “intellectually offensive frills” and so able to maintain some aspects of its universality and its legitimating influence.<a href=\"#m-en-64\">18</a> It could “legitimate both traditionalist regimes such as Saudi Arabia or Northern Nigeria, and socially radical ones such as Libya, South Yemen or Algeria.”<a href=\"#m-en-65\">19</a> Islam could function both to legitimate power and to universalize a particular culture.Scholars roundly criticized Gellner’s stance, and the kernel of his ideas remained unexamined for some time.

    "content": "Ernest Gellner wrote <i>Nations and Nationalism </i>primarily as a work of theory. He evokes a grand narrative of human history to illustrate the <a data-score=\"6\" id=\"m-ref124\" data-id=\"1500\" data-type=\"Term\">modern</a> origins of nationalism—that is, as having historical roots no older than the end of the fifteenth century, and owing much to the advent of industrialization in the mid-nineteenth century. The work is not a deep historical analysis, and Gellner does not deploy a great deal of data. Instead, the book is almost entirely argumentative.It is perhaps best, then, to assess Ernest Gellner’s theories by noting the many views of nationalism that he rejected. In the penultimate chapter of <i>Nations and Nationalism</i>, Gellner reminds his audience of what he considers to be four false theories of nationalism. The first false view suggests that nationalism is “natural and self-evident and self-generating”<a href=\"#m-en-67\">1</a>—that it is somehow fundamental to the human condition.<a href=\"#m-en-68\">2</a>The second false position argues that nationalism is “a regrettable accident” and that “political life even in industrial societies could do without it.”<a href=\"#m-en-69\">3</a> This view would suggest that no connection whatsoever exists between nationalism and industrialization.The third perspective involves the <a data-score=\"5\" id=\"m-ref125\" data-id=\"1498\" data-type=\"Term\">Marxist</a> view of nationalism, founded on the thought of the political theorist <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref126\" data-id=\"10189\" data-type=\"Person\">Karl Marx.</a> Gellner calls this “The Wrong Address Theory.”<a href=\"#m-en-70\">4</a> In the Marxist reading, societal advancement can only take place through <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref127\" data-id=\"1472\" data-type=\"Term\">class struggle,</a> not nationalism. Those who evoke the latter miss the point of revolution.Finally, Gellner rejects the view that sees nationalism as nothing more than “the re-emergence of the atavistic [that is, ancient and re-emergent] forces of blood and territory.”<a href=\"#m-en-71\">5</a> Gellner argues that both those who embrace nationalism and those who reject it endorse this perspective. Those who embrace nationalism view it as a way of renewing the nation’s soul. Those who reject it see nationalism as a barbarian movement leading to total disaster.To Gellner, none of these understandings of nationalism ring true.In his text, he refutes these notions, relying on a complex and compelling argument about social structure. Nationalism could not be supported by <a data-score=\"6\" id=\"m-ref128\" data-id=\"1458\" data-type=\"Term\">agrarian</a> social organization<a href=\"#m-en-72\">6</a>—that is, the society founded on an agricultural economy—and, therefore, it is not <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref129\" data-id=\"1516\" data-type=\"Term\">primordial,</a> or ancient. Nationalism is not an intellectual accident; it emerges from economic and social forces, not the transmission of a particular idea.<a href=\"#m-en-73\">7</a>To Gellner, the relationship of culture to power remains far more relevant to the rise of nationalism than class struggle or <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref130\" data-id=\"1467\" data-type=\"Term\">capitalism</a>—the economic and social system, dominant in the West, in which industry is private and the profits from the labor of working people go to private hands.<a href=\"#m-en-74\">8</a> Finally, Gellner offers an account of needs, or the way industrialization requires a certain social formation. This examination puts to rest the notion that nationalism is simply about blood and territory.<a href=\"#m-en-75\">9</a>",

    "content": "<i>Nations and Nationalism</i> follows logically from much of Ernest Gellner’s early work. The <a data-score=\"5\" id=\"m-ref143\" data-id=\"1525\" data-type=\"Term\">sociological</a> and <a data-score=\"7\" id=\"m-ref144\" data-id=\"1522\" data-type=\"Term\">social anthropological</a> concerns on display in <i>Nations and Nationalism </i>can be traced to his 1959 book <i>Words and Things</i>. In this work, he rejected a theory known as <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref145\" data-id=\"1507\" data-type=\"Term\">ordinary language philosophy.</a> Ordinary language philosophy limited philosophy to examining how language works in a given context or community. That is, it held that philosophy should not be concerned with determining what is universally true for all peoples in all societies. Instead, it should focus on how language operates as a system of meaning in a given community.Gellner believed ordinary language philosophy stripped the discipline of philosophy of any real significance. He argued that it reduced philosophy to nothing more than a descriptive enterprise incapable of offering solutions to the biggest challenges facing the modern world. Five years later, in 1964, he took up one of these challenges, nationalism, in his second published book, <i>Thought and Change</i>. This book contains many of the central elements that would later appear in <i>Nations and Nationalism</i>. Gellner’s interest in, and work on, Islam from the late 1960s until the early 1980s can also be found in <i>Nations and Nationalism</i>.<a href=\"#m-en-83\">1</a>Many of the ideas dominating <i>Nations and Nationalism</i> appear in <i>Thought and Change</i>. Indeed, chapter 7 offers a glimpse of what is to come in <i>Nations and Nationalism</i>. Gellner focuses on a break in human history: the transition from pre-industrial to <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref146\" data-id=\"1489\" data-type=\"Term\">industrial society.</a>As Gellner saw it, this transition radically changed how humans understood their world. Gellner argued in <i>Thought and Change</i> that nationalism came into existence as a result of <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref147\" data-id=\"1491\" data-type=\"Term\">industrialization.</a> It should not be viewed as a <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref148\" data-id=\"1516\" data-type=\"Term\">primordial,</a> or an ancient, notion going back to time immemorial. <i>Thought and Change </i>is also where Gellner developed the idea that nationalism must not be conceived of as random. He felt it should be connected with the various institutions and practices of a given state. States work to make nationalism seem “natural” because the concept helps to legitimate their existence.",

    "content": "Both <i>Words and Things</i> (1959) and <i>Thought and Change </i>(1964) function more as philosophical rather than anthropological texts. But the latter shows Gellner moving more fully into arguments around the social sciences—namely state formation and the history and effects of industrialization. This trajectory toward social and cultural anthropology grew stronger as Gellner conducted further studies on <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref149\" data-id=\"1492\" data-type=\"Term\">Islam</a> and <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref150\" data-id=\"1503\" data-type=\"Term\">Muslim</a> societies in North Africa. He published <i>Saints of the Atlas</i>, a study of pastoral peoples in Morocco, in 1969. He also published <i>Muslim Society</i> in 1981, a book in which he discussed the mechanisms that caused what he viewed as the stability and homogeneity (that is, the internal similarity) of Islamic societies.While many of the ideas present in <i>Nations and Nationalism</i> appeared first in <i>Thought and Change</i>, that book did not receive much attention when it was published in the mid-1960s. Gellner’s biographer, John A. Hall, notes that, in retrospect, it is clear that <i>Thought and Change</i> “foreshadows nearly all his later work,” aiming as it did to “provide a social philosophy of modern times.”<a href=\"#m-en-84\">2</a> In <i>Thought and Change</i>, Gellner addressed what he saw as two interrelated social phenomena: industrialization and nationalism. This exploration set the agenda for the focused study that would later become the most important work of his career, <i>Nations and Nationalism</i>.",

Gellner’s decision to leave Cambridge University to join the Central European University gave the institution great credibility.As director of the Center for the Study of Nationalism, Gellner attracted scholars, diplomats, and policy makers from central Europe and around the world. When Czechoslovakia split into two countries—the Czech Republic and Slovakia—Gellner held conferences and seminars on Czech and Slovakian nationalism aimed at analyzing the political divide between the two countries.Gellner also turned his attention to other parts of the world. His work on nationalism enabled him to influence public thinking on the situation of formerly dominant minorities in Hungary and Ireland. Gellner used the new research center to discuss a range of topics including Quebec’s desire for independence from Canada; the economic, political, and social void created when Russia rejected <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref156\" data-id=\"1475\" data-type=\"Term\">communism;</a> and the relationship between <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref157\" data-id=\"1493\" data-type=\"Term\">Islamic revivalism</a> and nationalism.<a href=\"#m-en-86\">4</a>",

    "content": "Ernest Gellner’s<i> Nations and Nationalism</i> was widely reviewed. The years following its publication in 1983 saw both praise and a number of criticisms of his main arguments.<a href=\"#m-en-87\">1</a> Several critics denied that a social scientist who stood outside of a given culture could determine how such a society actually operated.<a href=\"#m-en-88\">2</a> Believing such a thing is possible requires accepting that the scientist knows more about the real purpose of values than the people who are in fact practicing them. This is typically understood as <a id=\"m-ref161\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1483\" data-type=\"Term\">functionalism.</a> <a id=\"m-ref162\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"10160\" data-type=\"Person\">John Breuilly,</a> a professor of nationalism and ethnicity at the London School of Economics, explains that in Gellner’s text, “Nationalism is regarded as functional for industrialism … and its function serves to explain its existence (<a id=\"m-ref163\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1528\" data-type=\"Term\">teleology</a>).”<a href=\"#m-en-89\">3</a> In other words, <a id=\"m-ref164\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1490\" data-type=\"Term\">industrialism</a> requires nationalism—and that means nationalism must exist.Breuilly found this notion vague because there is no direct cause, arguing, “Industrialism is now less a process of social change underpinning nationalism and more a perceived need which motivates nationalists.”<a href=\"#m-en-90\">4</a> The mechanism whereby industrialization propels nationalism is not entirely clear in Breuilly’s view. Breuilly feels Gellner has shown a relationship between nationalism and industrialization but not an exact source.Others criticized Gellner for not providing more specific examples to historically ground what might appear to be a speculative theory on the origins of nationalism. Even so, Gellner’s former student <a id=\"m-ref165\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"10197\" data-type=\"Person\">Anthony D. Smith</a> commented, “How far [Gellner’s theory] can encompass the some 200 or so nationalisms to date would require more investigation than a general exposition permits.” Smith praised Gellner’s work as “broadly conceived and stimulating … for without theories to provide perspectives … the manifold researches of individuals becomes disjointed and fragmentary.”<a href=\"#m-en-91\">5</a>",

    "content": "Gellner’s work on nationalism never failed to provoke controversy. Shortly after his death in 1996, a compendium of essays analyzing his ideas was published under the title, <i>The Social Theory of Ernest Gellner</i>.<a href=\"#m-en-98\">12</a> In this text, critics leveled more charges against Gellner’s theory. The Australian historian Nick <a id=\"m-ref171\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"10199\" data-type=\"Person\">Stargardt</a> argued that industrialization does not necessarily require mass literacy or the standardization of language.<a href=\"#m-en-99\">13</a> He noted that industrialization in Great Britain occurred generations before compulsory education. Other essays in the book suggested that people in many major industrial cities speak a variety of native languages, which possibly undermines Gellner’s claim about the relationship between industry and a homogenous, or internally similar, <a id=\"m-ref172\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"1477\" data-type=\"Term\">culture</a> and language.<a href=\"#m-en-100\">14</a> More interestingly, a number of critics argued no relationship necessarily existed between industrialization and nationalism. They suggested nationalism may arise even in the absence of an <a id=\"m-ref173\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1489\" data-type=\"Term\">industrial society.</a> For example, nationalism occurred in colonial India, but its leading proponent, <a id=\"m-ref174\" data-score=\"3\" data-id=\"10171\" data-type=\"Person\">Mahatma Gandhi,</a> explicitly rejected Western industrialization.<a href=\"#m-en-101\">15</a> As this collection of critical essays demonstrated, many of the charges leveled at the book when it was published in the 1980s remained relevant years later. The rise of other theories brought new kinds of scrutiny to Gellner’s work. For example, <a id=\"m-ref175\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1514\" data-type=\"Term\">postcolonial theory</a> sought to analyze and destabilize the modes of thought that support Western <a id=\"m-ref176\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1474\" data-type=\"Term\">colonialism</a> and <a id=\"m-ref177\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1488\" data-type=\"Term\">imperialism.</a> Encompassing several academic disciplines, it removed European narratives from their formerly central place in scholarly conversation and added a new focus on the histories of peoples in other parts of the globe. The use and interpretation of history remained at the center of Gellner’s battles with proponents of postcolonial theory, particularly the scholar <a id=\"m-ref178\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"10196\" data-type=\"Person\">Edward Said.</a> Newer works on nationalism by postcolonial theorists, such as those by the Indian scholar <a id=\"m-ref179\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"10161\" data-type=\"Person\">Partha Chatterjee</a> in the 1990s, have offered alternative interpretations of nationalism in non-European contexts. They have also questioned whether Gellner’s theories apply to the world outside of Europe.<a href=\"#m-en-102\">16</a> ",

In particular, he responded to critiques by publishing two additional texts. Both <i>Encounters with Nationalism </i>in 1994 and the posthumously published <i>Nationalism</i> (1997) added to his basic theory in substantive ways. In this last book, Gellner “put forward a new way of classifying <a id=\"m-ref182\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1504\" data-type=\"Term\">nationalism,</a> largely overlapping with the previous <a id=\"m-ref183\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1529\" data-type=\"Term\">typology.</a>”<a href=\"#m-en-103\">1</a> Gellner’s new concept divided the history of nationalism into stages and geographic zones. Both the zones and the historical examples that he cites focus almost entirely on Europe, bypassing the charge that Gellner’s theory is inapplicable to other regions.<a href=\"#m-en-104\">2</a> Gellner did make a significant revision to his discussion of <a id=\"m-ref184\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1492\" data-type=\"Term\">Islam.</a> He included the Muslim world as one of his “zones.” Instead of arguing that Islam would facilitate nationalism, Gellner argued that the religion “emerged as the dominant and victorious trend” over nationalism.<a href=\"#m-en-105\">3</a> Gellner’s views on Islam raised the ire of the Palestinian American <a id=\"m-ref185\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"1514\" data-type=\"Term\">postcolonial theorist</a> <a id=\"m-ref186\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"10196\" data-type=\"Person\">Edward Said.</a> Said suggested that Gellner’s perspective was potentially driven by <a id=\"m-ref187\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1487\" data-type=\"Term\">ideology</a>—that, in fact, it was indistinguishable from Western <a id=\"m-ref188\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1488\" data-type=\"Term\">imperialism.</a> Said argued that Gellner’s work on Islam presupposed Western standards of truth and reason, which led Gellner to a biased and prejudiced understanding of Islamic societies.<a href=\"#m-en-106\">4</a> In a now-famous battle in the pages of the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>, Gellner and Said traded barbs. The spat began when Gellner reviewed Said’s book <i>Culture and Imperialism</i>, in which Said criticized Gellner’s views on nationalism. Writing of “<a id=\"m-ref189\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1508\" data-type=\"Term\">Orientalism,”</a> Said’s argument that in the European colonial imagination the civilizations east of Europe were exotic and uncivilized, with certain implications that endure in many forms of Western culture, Gellner said that Said was “inventing a bogy called Orientalism” and that “the problem of power and culture … is too important to be left to [literary criticism].”<a href=\"#m-en-107\">5</a> Said replied that “the generalities which he adduces to my argument are his, not mine.” He accused Gellner of being ignorant about both <a id=\"m-ref190\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1503\" data-type=\"Term\">Muslim</a> societies and Orientalism.<a href=\"#m-en-108\">6</a> Gellner’s reaction sought to characterize Said’s idea of Orientalism “as the attribution of superior merit and truth in virtue of <i>who </i>one is … rather than to the affirmations themselves on merit.”<a href=\"#m-en-109\">7</a> While the argument continued through several more published letters, the essential difference between the two men involves their interpretation of the motives of history. For Gellner, grand historical forces set in motion Western imperialism and nationalism, a “transformation of the world by a new technology, economy and science.”<a href=\"#m-en-110\">8</a> For Said, imperialism was also a cultural project, which explains his emphasis on those who “represent the historical experience of <a id=\"m-ref191\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"1479\" data-type=\"Term\">decolonization.”</a><a href=\"#m-en-111\">9</a> Both Gellner and Said are interested in the relationship of power to culture.

Nationalism continues as a force in today’s societies. It shapes both individual identities and relations between people. Some nation states in the contemporary world are relatively young. Countries such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE), founded in 1971, include diverse populations from different parts of the globe. But the UAE offers very limited paths to citizenship. In such countries, the state supports events and programs designed to invent, encourage, and educate people about a particular national vision of “heritage.”<a href=\"#m-en-135\">2</a> Future scholars may debate whether Gellner’s thesis applies to such places, even as young countries grow and change.Gellner’s work may have continued relevance in judging the importance of nationalism as a force shaping relations between people.

    "content": "Ernest Gellner’s <i>Nations and Nationalism</i> offers a readable and innovative account of the origin of two important phenomena: 1) the nation, and 2) the idea of the nation, generally called nationalism. Gellner’s book was the first to make a clear argument about the connection between nationalism and the modern world. He theorized that nations formed as a result of the social and cultural changes brought on by industrialization.Gellner’s book has stood the test of time because of its sophistication and the clarity of his model. His text does a great deal of conceptual work. He connects significant changes in the economy—specifically, industrialization—to the modern state, education, culture, and power. Because of the work’s broad range and the causal links Gellner draws between these concepts, <i>Nations and Nationalism</i> has inspired many readers. It has also invited much criticism and provided countless avenues of new research for scholars in a number of academic disciplines.Economic forces, technology, science, and culture continue to change the world, so Gellner’s theory continues to receive attention. It may even gain new relevance. Questions about globalization, migration, and war, in particular, all test Gellner’s ideas about the links between economic development, cultural homogeneity, and the power of the state.

    "content": "Despite spending most of his life in England, T. S. Eliot was actually American. He was born in 1888 in St. Louis, Missouri, and could trace his ancestry back to the early founders of New England. Eliot’s grandfather, William Greenleaf Eliot, had left New England in the 1830s, moving west from Massachusetts to found a church in St. Louis. William Eliot was a Unitarian minister: a Christian who believed that God existed in one person, not three (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit). Rather than stressing the fact that Jesus Christ was a divine being, Unitarians emphasized the power of Christ’s moral teachings. It was a religion that prized rationality over simple doctrines and the importance of reason ahead of worship.&nbsp;The Eliot family remained in St. Louis throughout Eliot’s childhood, but spent their summers in New England. This allowed them to retain important connections to the educational and religious culture of the eastern United States. Among the family’s distinguished New England relatives were a number of notable American figures: the novelists <a data-id=\"10452\" data-type=\"Person\">Nathaniel Hawthorne</a> and <a data-id=\"10459\" data-type=\"Person\">Herman Melville</a> and the American presidents <a data-id=\"10437\" data-type=\"Person\">John Adams</a> and <a data-id=\"10438\" data-type=\"Person\">John Quincy Adams.</a>Following both undergraduate and doctoral studies at Harvard University, a move to England in 1914, and marriage to Vivienne Haigh-Wood, Eliot accepted a post in the colonial and foreign department at Lloyds Bank in London. In 1917, he was invited to join the literary journal the <em>Athenaeum </em>as assistant editor. Most of the essays in <em>The Sacred Wood</em> were originally published in the <em>Athenaeum</em>. But even as Eliot started to build a literary reputation, he continued to work at Lloyds, developing his poetry and literary criticism outside of office hours. Biographical sources suggest that Eliot was under marital and financial strain, which is thought to have contributed to his decision to remain in steady employment throughout his early career.By the time Eliot began to write the essays that would eventually be collected in <em>The Sacred Wood</em> (published in 1920), he had already distanced himself from his family’s Unitarianism. But his background may have helped form some of his views, including his dislike of personal emotional expression and his belief in the importance of analysis. A theme that runs through <em>The Sacred Wood</em> is that analysis, rather than an emotional response to a work, is a crucial part of literary criticism. The collection also stated that poetry should present concrete, real images, which the reader can perceive, rather than simply be a vehicle through which to express the writer’s emotions.<a href=\"#m-en-51\" title=\" Eric Sigg, “Eliot as a Product of America,” in The Cambridge Companion to T.

    "content": "Eliot started his own literary career in earnest around 1910, when skepticism toward nineteenth-century literary values was beginning to take hold. The <a data-id=\"1875\" data-type=\"Term\">Romantic</a> movement of that earlier period suggested that self-expression should be prized above all else. Romantic writers believed that an individual’s personal response to something had huge value. Modernists criticized this attitude, arguing that the emphasis on personal emotion and individual response meant Romantic poetry was often lacking in ideas and intellectual content. The Romantics emphasized beauty in poetry: beauty of language, image, and poetic form. Their lofty style, dedicated to the appreciation of what was beautiful (aesthetics) seemed increasingly out of touch as the twentieth century got underway. The devastation of World War I only served to confirm that.When war first broke out in 1914, the names, themes, and ideas that would be associated with modernism were just beginning to appear. But the romanticized portrayals of country life and dreamy visions that the Romantic Poets trumpeted seemed far removed from the devastations of wartime Europe. In the years that followed the war, Eliot—along with other modernist writers such as <a data-id=\"10461\" data-type=\"Person\">Ezra Pound</a> and <a data-id=\"10468\" data-type=\"Person\">Gertrude Stein</a>—would repeatedly try out new poetic styles. They explored new poetic forms, introduced disjointed rhythms, and used different techniques to create verse that was unified in its ideas, but fragmented in its form. That starkly differed from the Romantics, whose poetry had followed certain rules—for example, creating “perfect sonnets.” But the fragmented style of the Modernists seemed to strike a chord as Europe struggled to comprehend the awful realities of the four years of the war from 1914 to 1918 and the breakdown of political and social structures.In his 1928 preface to an updated version of <em>The Sacred Wood</em>, Eliot described the social and political environment between 1917 and 1920 as representing “a transition between the period immediately before the First World War and the period since.”<a href=\"#m-en-61\" title=\" T. S. Eliot, The Sacred Wood: Essays on Poetry and Criticism (London: Faber &amp; Faber, 1997), ix.\">2</a> The huge turmoil that resulted from the war defined the social and political climate. Eliot recognized that this war had had a huge impact on the people who survived it. Its horror had undermined their ability to cope with even everyday life. <em>The Sacred Wood</em> reflects a growing sense of unrest in society and of the failures of literature and culture to interpret and understand the realities of post-war Europe.",

Eliot’s concept of the “objective correlative.” This refers to how successfully the techniques used by a poet create understanding for the reader. Do the images, gestures, and chain of events within the poem correlate with (i.e. match) the poem’s objective (i.e. its intention)? This idea rested on Eliot’s view that perception—or the true contemplation of reality—is the goal of poetry.Other secondary ideas include Eliot’s discussion of creative and critical minds and his treatment of the existing intellectual culture in which a work is created. This latter idea had implications that went beyond literature. But Eliot’s intention was that the subject of <i>The Sacred Wood</i> should be “ the problem of the integrity of poetry.”<a href=\"#m-en-231\" title=\" T. S.

Eliot makes this claim because <em>Hamlet </em>does not pass Eliot’s objective correlative test. What’s presented “externally” through the images and actions of the play does not match its emotional content.Eliot’s idea of the objective correlative is closely related to the <a data-id=\"1860\" data-type=\"Term\">Imagist</a> movement of the 1910s. The Imagists believed that poetry should present concrete objects in such a way that they produce an emotional reaction in the reader. What was original about Eliot was the way he applied this idea as the test of an entire play. This was so boldly original that it gave the concept added influence.<a href=\"#m-en-241\" title=\" Louis Menand, Discovering Modernism: T. S. Eliot and His Context, 2nd ed. (New York: Oxford University Press, 2007), 134–139.\">2</a>Eliot’s discussion of creative minds as compared to critical minds looks at the distinct roles that each of those minds should play in literary culture and achievement. Both sorts of mind, he argues, must have a historical sense of literature, which they should cultivate throughout their careers. Creative minds need to be conscious of tradition in order to surrender to it. Critical minds need to measure the achievements of the present against the whole of literary tradition. By doing so, they can help writers understand their place within that tradition.Eliot argues that criticism should be an intelligent analysis of the sensations produced by a work of art. Just like the poet, the critic’s work should be undiluted by emotions and based on perception. Such criticism is capable of illuminating a work of art and increasing its value for the reader. In doing so it can help lead to the ultimate goal of poetry: pure contemplation. It isn’t clear exactly what Eliot means when he uses that phrase. It can be read as contemplation of God or deep consideration and reflection about the fundamental nature of reality. But Eliot believes such contemplation can help readers live more fulfilling, meaningful lives.Eliot’s treatment of intellectual culture—the thoughts and beliefs that frame a society—is, in many ways, an argument against what he saw as a lack of intellectual content in the literature of the nineteenth century. The Elizabethan age was Eliot’s model for intellectual culture. Its literature showed “a very high development of the senses … when the intellect was immediately at the tips of the senses.”<a href=\"#m-en-242\" title=\" Eliot, Sacred Wood, 109.\">3</a> Elizabethan morals “provided a framework for emotions to which all classes could respond.”<a href=\"#m-en-243\" title=\" Eliot, Sacred Wood, 114.\">4</a>Eliot also celebrates the age of <a data-id=\"10449\" data-type=\"Person\">Dante:</a> the end of the thirteenth century and the early part of the fourteenth century. He argues that, in Florence at that time, society worked within an intellectual, philosophical, and moral framework that everybody understood. It was part of daily life. That framework made it easier for Dante to state a vision of life in his poetry, which in turn helped to guide the reader into the state of contemplation.",

    "content": "In the years following the publication of <em>The Sacred Wood</em>, Eliot became renowned as a poet as well as a critic. The publication of <em>The Waste Land</em> in 1922 immediately established his reputation as a major poet and is generally hailed as a watershed moment in twentieth-century literature. In the 40 or so years of productive work that followed, Eliot turned his attention at various points to playwriting, social criticism, and social theory.However, the ideas he developed in <em>The Sacred Wood</em> continued to shape his literary criticism. They also established a framework for interpreting the poetry and drama that he wrote throughout his career. In that sense <em>The Sacred Wood</em> was an argument, as Eliot later wrote, “for the sort of poetry that I and my friends wrote.”<a href=\"#m-en-301\" title=\" T. S. Eliot, “To Criticize the Critic,” in To Criticize the Critic and Other Writings, ed. Valerie Eliot (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1965), 16.\">1</a> It was a manifesto as well as an instruction manual for appreciating the poetic style to which Eliot aspired.Despite having been written at various points over three years, the essays in <em>The Sacred Wood</em> are more or less unified in their treatment of literary concepts and themes. In the main, they deal with literature itself, but the ideas expressed anticipate the shift that Eliot would gradually make towards dealing with social and cultural issues at large. In the essay “Tradition and the Individual Talent,” Eliot argues that the poet must have a sense of tradition that involves knowledge of the past—knowledge that he or she must acquire over a lifetime of study and thought. The essay deals specifically with literature, but it anticipates the way in which Eliot’s concept of “tradition” would broaden to include a wider cultural interest in the past.Eliot’s later critical works, such as <em>Notes Toward the Definition of Culture</em> (1938) and <em>The Idea of a Christian Society</em> (1939) developed these ideas further. But they did so in different and sometimes conflicting ways. The American literary critic <a data-id=\"10460\" data-type=\"Person\">Louis Menand</a> summarized Eliot’s work through the 1920s and 1930s. He said it argued for <a data-id=\"1849\" data-type=\"Term\">classicism</a> in the form of “a pan-European culture, diversified according to language and regional tradition, but united as part of the civilization of Western Christendom.” In the 1940s and 1950s, Eliot turned his attention to the new theme of “provincialism”—his term for the limitations and difficulties imposed on poets by their cultural and historical circumstances.<a href=\"#m-en-302\" title=\" Louis Menand, Discovering Modernism: T.

The American poet William Carlos <a data-id=\"10469\" data-type=\"Person\">Williams</a> rejected Eliot as a cultural elitist. He contended that Eliot was highly educated, and <em>The Sacred Wood</em> seemed to suggest that all writers needed that level of education to produce anything of value. Williams also believed Eliot’s proposed program to make poetry intellectually richer was damaging to the growth of poetry rooted in local culture.By and large, however, university academics embraced Eliot’s concepts. <em>The Sacred Wood</em> immediately became a central text in literature studies at both Oxford and Cambridge Universities.<a href=\"#m-en-361\" title=\" Louis Menand, Discovering Modernism: T.

Those views raised such writers’ own aspirations to meet the literary requirements that Eliot set out in <em>The Sacred Wood</em>.The common view in literary London was that Eliot represented the post-war re-emergence of literary values such as detachment, intelligence, and impersonality. Early reviewers of <em>The Sacred Wood</em>, like the writer and critic Leonard Woolf,&nbsp;emphasized that view. They approved of Eliot’s scientific approach and the value of using methods such as comparison and analysis. The American writer <a data-id=\"10439\" data-type=\"Person\">Conrad Aiken</a> disagreed. He was one of the few critics at the time who took a stance against Eliot's “scientific” approach, arguing that art can neither be “impersonal” nor “scientific.”<a href=\"#m-en-362\" title=\" Jewel Spears Brooker, T.

In line with Eliot’s ideas on impersonality, New Criticism believed that a text should be studied on its own, without looking for biographical or personal influences that may have informed the writing. But in the 1970s, new types of literary scholarship came to the fore that emphasized external influences on texts, like the author’s class or gender. As these ideas emerged, the Eliot-inspired literary theory of New Criticism fell out of favor.The biggest blow to Eliot’s reputation, however, resulted from his social and cultural ideas. Powerful fascist regimes emerged in Europe in the 1930s, followed by <a data-id=\"1879\" data-type=\"Term\">World War II.</a> Through the decades of political reflection that inevitably ensued, Eliot’s cultural ideas became extremely unpopular.

    "content": "<em>The Sacred Wood</em> came out in 1920 and is a collection of 13 of T. S. Eliot's early essays of literary criticism.&nbsp;Written between 1917 and 1920, they were first published as stand-alone pieces.In the first essay in the collection, \"The Perfect Critic,” Eliot discusses how he thinks critics should judge a work of literature and why literary criticism is important. Eliot stresses that critics should have a profound understanding of the literature of the past. By the past, he means the literary tradition of the West, which had grown from the classical works of the <a data-id=\"1856\" data-type=\"Term\">Greco-Roman</a> world. He believes that the greatest writers were to be found in the <a reign=\"\" s=\"\" data-id=\"1854\" data-type=\"Term\">Elizabethan Age</a> (1558-1603) and in the time of <a data-id=\"10449\" data-type=\"Person\">Dante</a> (1265-1321). For Eliot, the achievements of those writers far surpassed the work of the <a data-id=\"1875\" data-type=\"Term\">Romantics</a> of the nineteenth century.Eliot says that when critics have a deep knowledge of this long literary tradition, they then have the necessary level of insight to critique new works. They are able to see how a new work compares with work that has come before, which in turn allows them to assess the value of the new work accurately.Eliot argues that a critic should not base this assessment on his or her emotional response to a text, but rather on a thoughtful, critical analysis of it. He explores these themes in more depth in the next five essays, which he groups together under the title, “The Imperfect Critic.”&nbsp;After calling on critics to judge a work by assessing it against the work of the past, he moves on to discuss the role of the creative writer. He contends that writers, too, should measure their work in the same way and understand the literary tradition within which they write. Only by doing so can they achieve their full potential.In <em>The Sacred Wood</em> Eliot writes primarily about poetry. He says that poems should display integrity and “impersonality.\" By integrity, he means that all the elements of a poem should work together—integrate—to create the meaning of that poem. In the same way, a piece of literature should integrate with the great body of literature that precedes it. It should be understood as part of that literary tradition. By impersonality, Eliot means that the poet should strip away his or her personality and emotions from the poem. The poem should have its own emotion. That was in direct contrast to the ideas of the Romantic tradition, which had valued individuality and self-expression.To illustrate his arguments, Eliot looks at the work of individual authors. Each of the last seven essays in the book focuses on a different writer.&nbsp;Some of those writers are well-known: <a data-id=\"10449\" data-type=\"Person\">Dante,</a> <a data-id=\"10466\" data-type=\"Person\">Shakespeare,</a><a data-id=\"10463\" data-type=\"Person\"> Christopher Marlowe.</a> Others, like Algernon <a data-id=\"10470\" data-type=\"Person\">Charles Swinburne</a> and <a data-id=\"10458\" data-type=\"Person\">Philip Massinger</a> are more obscure. Eliot critiques their work, judging it by his standards of literary achievement. These critiques help to clarify what Eliot meant by great literature and on what grounds a literary work should be assessed.",

    "content": "Eliot had experienced some success even before he published <em>The Sacred Wood</em>. The essays that make up the collection had already appeared in some of London's literary magazines, and he had also published several poems. They included the well-received “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,” which first appeared in 1915.But it was <em>The Sacred Wood</em> that proved to be a pivotal moment in Eliot's career. An instant success, it turned him into one of the most highly regarded literary critics in London. Many of the ideas contained in the book went on to become hugely important to literary modernism. In turn, modernism affected other key literary movements of the twentieth century.Eliot’s arguments also set the stage for a major shift within literary criticism. When Eliot was writing The Sacred Wood, the people who produced literary criticism tended to be writers. But Eliot's ideas about the role of the critic—and the qualities of the critical mind—helped to change that. <em>The Sacred Wood</em> fueled the growing trend for academics taking on the critic's role.Eliot is now seen as one of the greatest poets in the twentieth century, which explains why he is better known as a poet than as a critic. But to understand Eliot’s poetic aims, it’s vital to explore the ideas he expressed in <em>The Sacred Wood</em>. This is also extremely important in helping understand the poets who came after him. Eliot’s influence was so great that his ideas influenced—directly or indirectly—most of the major English-language poets of the twentieth century.Beyond poetry, Eliot’s ideas have also been important in certain religious debates. He believed in tradition and the importance of integrating the present with the past, and these theories have been discussed in relation to change within the Anglican Church.Political theorists also continue to debate Eliot’s thinking. In <em>The Sacred Wood</em>, he argues that literature flourishes within particular intellectual cultures. These cultures, he says, are bound together by clear religious and philosophical values. In the early 1930s, Eliot expanded this theory into a discussion of what an ideal intellectual society might look like. These later ideas seemed sympathetic to Europe’s emerging <a data-id=\"1855\" data-type=\"Term\">fascist</a> and <a data-id=\"1865\" data-type=\"Term\">nationalist</a> regimes, and as such they damaged Eliot’s reputation. The literary world tends to regard Eliot’s social and political comments as problematic.Yet some influential political theorists have a different view. They point out that, in fact, Eliot rejected the ideologies of communism and fascism. Others have also noted that it’s important to view Eliot’s ideas within the context of his times. Eliot was writing before <a data-id=\"1880\" data-type=\"Term\">World War II</a> and before the full horrors of the <a data-id=\"1858\" data-type=\"Term\">Holocaust</a> had been revealed. Given that, his comments could be seen as naive. In the final analysis, <em>The Sacred Wood</em> remains a highly relevant text for people interested in political theory because it expresses ideas about the relationship between social frameworks and human achievement.",

    "content": "<em>The Sacred Wood</em> is a collection of 13 essays of literary criticism that T. S. Eliot wrote between 1917 and 1920, while he was living in London. Although originally written as independent pieces, many of the same themes and ideas link the essays together. They include the value of <a data-id=\"1861\" data-type=\"Term\">“integrity”</a> in art, the importance of understanding what has gone before in the literary past, and the nature of the relationship between the artist and the critic.Brought together in <em>The Sacred Wood</em>, the essays were an immediate success. The book established Eliot’s reputation as one of the most influential and highly regarded critics in London. Modernists—writers of the time who were interested in breaking with recent literary conventions and redefining literary values—particularly responded to <em>The Sacred Wood</em>. Eliot’s ideas about what made for a successful poem would go on to become defining concepts in literary modernism.Nowadays, Eliot is better known as a poet than as a critic. But for anyone wanting to understand his literary and cultural aims, as well as the literary movements and important debates of the twentieth century, <em>The Sacred Wood</em> remains an essential text.",

    "content": "Thomas Stearns Eliot (1888–1965) was an American-born writer who moved to London in 1914 and remained there for the rest of his life, working as a poet, cultural and literary critic, editor, and financier. Nowadays Eliot is best known as a major twentieth-century poet, but his critical writing has also had a profound influence on other writers and thinkers. His literary theories became central concerns of <a data-id=\"1863\" data-type=\"Term\">modernism,</a> an important cultural movement of the early twentieth century. Modernists rejected the artistic values of the nineteenth century and looked for new ways of thinking about art and literature.After moving to London, Eliot became friends with many of the writers, artists, and thinkers associated with modernism. Among them were the poet <a data-id=\"10461\" data-type=\"Person\">Ezra Pound</a> and the writer <a data-id=\"10472\" data-type=\"Person\">Virginia Woolf.</a> Eliot’s own reputation as a significant figure started to grow in 1920, with the publication of <em>The Sacred Wood</em>. This collection of 13 essays of literary criticism was an instant success and turned him into an acclaimed literary critic.Within two years, he had also been hailed as a major poet. Eliot’s poem <em>The Waste Land</em> was published in 1922, the same year as <a data-id=\"10464\" data-type=\"Person\">James Joyce’s</a> <em>Ulysses</em>. Experimental in style, it captured the sense of fragmentation in post-war Europe. Europe’s population had been devastated, most survivors had lost loved ones, and the political structures and cultural values that had defined pre-war Europe had been shattered. They hadn’t yet transformed into something new. Like <em>Ulysses</em>, <em>The Waste Land</em> came to be regarded as a defining text of literary modernism.Eliot died in 1965 in London, but his poetry and literary criticism continue to influence literature today.",

    "content": "A question that is often asked is, “What makes a piece of art beautiful?” To complicate this issue, different people mean different things when they talk about beauty. Some focus simply on form: whether the work is visually or audibly appealing. Others use the discussion of beauty—aesthetics— to talk about what gives a piece of work value. In thinking about the value of a literary text, many writers and thinkers of the early twentieth century were influenced by the French philosopher <a data-id=\"10442\" data-type=\"Person\">Henri Bergson.</a> He drew on the scientific principles of observation and analysis to argue that writers should carefully look at what is around them and use the evidence of their senses to think about what they are experiencing. They should then convey those realities to their readers.Bergson’s ideas became a starting point for the <a data-id=\"1860\" data-type=\"Term\">Imagist</a> movement in poetry. The movement began in 1912 when <a data-id=\"10461\" data-type=\"Person\">Ezra Pound</a> declared the existence of a new school of poetry dedicated to Pound’s “Doctrine of the Image.” According to that manifesto, poetry should use concrete images that conjure up solid, tangible objects, or situations and that produce a definite sensation in the reader. The Imagist school of poetry dominated the London literary scene throughout the 1910s.Those values of perception, concrete representation, and analytic rigor were all under discussion in the early twentieth century. Perception meant the reader’s ability to grasp reality through a piece of writing. Concrete representation meant using real, tangible objects to help the reader seize on more abstract feelings or truths. And analytic rigor meant the writer’s ability to analyze what he or she was seeing and sensing and then find a meaningful way of conveying that to a reader.Eliot affirms those values in <em>The Sacred Wood</em>, so his work captures the spirit of his time. But he also broadened thought about literature. While some of his contemporaries sought to break from the past altogether, Eliot argues that, on the contrary, it was vital for writers to know what had come before them. A writer was, by definition, part of a literary tradition that went back centuries. By understanding his place in a long literary line, Eliot was able to bring a new perspective to his generation’s criticism of the Romantics. He argues that writers should look at their own work in the context of the greatest writers of the past, particularly classical and Elizabethan works, rather than judging them against the Romantics of the nineteenth century alone.At a time of when old ideologies were being questioned, Eliot developed a vision that affirmed, integrated, and broadened the literary sensibilities of Britain and America. This was one of the great achievements of <em>The Sacred Wood</em>.",

    "content": "In the years leading up to the publication of <em>The Sacred Wood</em>, Eliot had studied in Paris and at the University of Oxford, completed a dissertation in philosophy at Harvard University, and immersed himself in the literary world of London. His studies in philosophy brought him into contact with <a data-id=\"10464\" data-type=\"Person\">Josiah Royce,</a> the Harvard philosopher who supervised his dissertation, and also made him familiar with F. H. <a data-id=\"10445\" data-type=\"Person\">Bradley,</a> the philosopher who became the subject of that dissertation.<a href=\"#m-en-91\" title=\" T. S. Eliot, Knowledge and Experience in the Philosophy of F. H. Bradley (London: Faber &amp; Faber, 1964). Eliot’s dissertation was accepted by Harvard College in 1916, but was published only in 1964, a year before his death.\">1</a>Royce and Bradley were known as pragmatic idealists. They believed it was important to find meaning in life and to develop a coherent framework for interpreting life. But the reason they believed those things were important was because having a sense of meaning and a framework within which to exist actually helped people to survive. Royce and Bradley did not argue for the pursuit of truth and meaning just for the sake of it. Pursuing truth and meaning had practical benefits. Eliot’s view of tradition was similarly pragmatic. He valued the moral and cultural benefits that understanding the literary tradition could bring. Literature could help teach people how to live a rewarding life. It could also form one of the cultural links that help to bind societies together.One can also see the ideas of English philosopher Bertrand <a data-id=\"10455\" data-type=\"Person\">Russell</a> in Eliot’s work. The two men became close friends when Eliot was studying at Oxford in 1914. Russell’s emphasis on critical rigor—careful, thorough thought and analysis—probably influenced Eliot’s highly analytical approach to literature in <em>The Sacred Wood</em>.<a href=\"#m-en-92\" title=\" Richard Shusterman, “Eliot as Philosopher” in The Cambridge Companion to T. S. Eliot, ed. A. David Moody (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994), 32–38.\">2</a>Eliot explicitly credited the French theorist <a data-id=\"10450\" data-type=\"Person\">Remy de Gourmont</a> as an influence. Gourmont said that sensation and perception should be central to literary criticism. Sensation refers to what we experience through our senses. Perception refers to the way we use those sensations to gather information. These are things that can be measured, so they can be analyzed. That means they can be objectively observed, so a critic can judge a work with a degree of objectivity, rather than relying on a more abstract inner reasoning.Many of London’s literary debates in the 1910s and 1920s were played out in journals devoted to the subject such as the <em>Athenaeum</em>, where Eliot was assistant editor for a time and where many of the essays in <em>The Sacred Wood</em> were first published. So the environments in which these debates happened were not academic. They took place in the world of the literary and cultural elite of London and, to a certain extent, among any English speakers who cared to read the articles.",

    "content": "In the London literary culture of the 1910s, matters of literature and art were generally the concern of writers and critics, rather than of philosophers or academics. That was because literary criticism had emerged as a part of the literary profession. Widely circulated literary magazines were used as a forum for such debates, so <i>writers</i> usually wrote reflections on literature in that era. What they wrote was based on their own experiences as both writers and readers.By the time Eliot began to write the essays that would become <em>The Sacred Wood</em>, he already had a small reputation in the literary world. He’d also become friendly with the poet <a data-id=\"10461\" data-type=\"Person\">Ezra Pound,</a> who was one of the leaders of a school of poetry called <a data-id=\"1860\" data-type=\"Term\">Imagism</a> in the 1910s. Imagists emphasized that poets should present visual images in their poetry. People who were drawn to Imagism believed that poetry should use regular language and concrete descriptions, images that could be visualized in the mind. This directness of presentation and economy of language had more in common with earlier classical poetry than the Romantic works of the late nineteenth century.What made <em>The Sacred Wood</em> a groundbreaking book when it was published was the way Eliot blended the new ideas and concerns of modernism with a deep respect for the achievements of the past. He explores this idea in one essay in particular, “Tradition and the Individual Talent.” In it, Eliot discusses his concept of “tradition”: the idea that any poet is, by definition, part of a great poetic tradition, and his or her work needs to be judged and understood as part of that tradition. It has been suggested that Eliot derived his concept of tradition in part from Pound.<a href=\"#m-en-111\" title=\" Jean-Michel Rabaté, “Tradition and T. S. Eliot,” in The Cambridge Companion to T.

They aspired to new literary and artistic ideals. The general interest in these issues set the stage for Eliot’s argument in <em>The Sacred Wood</em>. Many people felt that artists should reject the works of the nineteenth century. But before Eliot, no one had been able to define how to relate to the wider literary past.",

In his introduction to <em>The Sacred Wood</em>, he cites the nineteenth-century English literary critic <a data-id=\"10440\" data-type=\"Person\">Matthew Arnold.</a> Arnold’s view was that the work of the <a data-id=\"1875\" data-type=\"Term\">Romantic poets</a> didn’t contain enough ideas or intellectual content. Eliot uses that judgment as the basis for emphasizing that analysis is crucial to criticism. Arnold’s arguments also related to another of Eliot’s key points: that any creative work is produced within a particular intellectual culture, and that culture strongly influences the work itself.In <em>The Sacred Wood</em>, Eliot brings together in one place many of the concerns of early twentieth-century literature and philosophy. The work stands out because it represents a much broader and more mature vision of literary culture and tradition than his contemporaries and colleagues had previously put forward.",

    "content": "T. S. Eliot’s literary analysis in <em>The Sacred Wood</em> is in many ways an argument against the Romantic poets. On the question of how literature should be analyzed, Eliot points out that the trend of criticism at the time was to search out (and value) what was <em>individual </em>in the work and thus what was <em>different </em>from the writer’s predecessors. But Eliot argues that both writers and critics should evaluate works of literature in relation to the works of both the past and the present. It is only by looking at literature as a whole, he contends, that an assessment can be made of the quality of a new work.Eliot’s views on literature in <em>The Sacred Wood</em> stood apart from contemporary discussions of <a data-id=\"1841\" data-type=\"Term\">aesthetics</a> and literary judgments. His criteria for valuing a work of literature required knowledge not only of the work itself, but also of its relationship to the literary tradition.Eliot also addresses the question of the relationship between the artist and the work of art. The Romantic ideal as set out by <a data-id=\"10473\" data-type=\"Person\">William Wordsworth</a> is that poetry is “emotion recollected in tranquility.”* After having an experience that provokes an emotion, Wordsworth believed poets should retreat and shape that emotional experience into a poem. Eliot disagrees. His view is that poetry should transform experience and emotion into art: something entirely different to the original experiences and emotions that prompted the poet to write. As part of this process, personal emotion should be removed from the poem. The final poem has, therefore, an emotion all of its own. This concept, which Eliot calls the “impersonality” of poetry, argues directly against the Romantics, whose poetry was preoccupied with expressing the emotions of the individual poets.",

But Eliot’s ideas laid out a standard for how literary <a data-id=\"1863\" data-type=\"Term\">modernists</a> ought to relate both to the past <em>and </em>to their own emotional lives and experiences. These ideas immediately became influential.Ezra Pound had written about the interlinked nature of the great minds of all ages. The literary academic Jean-Michel <a data-id=\"10457\" data-type=\"Person\">Rabaté</a> suggested that Eliot may have used this idea to build his theory of tradition. But Eliot’s concept is more wide reaching than Pound’s. It includes <em>all </em>of the poetry that has ever been written, not only the great successes.Eliot also makes a broader argument. He says that any given work of art draws on the culture within which it is created. As well as being part of a literary tradition, art is also part of an intellectual tradition shaped by morality, philosophy, and theology, among other things.Eliot’s linked concepts of tradition, integrity, and perception drew on emerging modernist understandings of what literary achievement actually was. He took contemporary objections to Romantic values and contemporary ideas about what poetry should do and transformed them into a sophisticated literary vision.",

    "content": "Eliot studied philosophy at Harvard <a data-id=\"1861\" data-type=\"Term\">University</a> between 1906 and 1909, and he focused his dissertation on the work of English philosopher F. H. <a data-id=\"10445\" data-type=\"Person\">Bradley.</a> Bradley believed that reality is made up of many interrelated parts. Each of those parts gets its meaning from its own individual place within reality, in much the same way that a group of individuals comes together to create a society. Each person forms a sense of self from his or her place within that society. Likewise a song is made up of many notes, but each note finds its meaning within the song as a whole.Drawing on this idea, Eliot developed a concept of pragmatic idealism in his dissertation. His argument was that traditions help create understanding between the people who make up any given society. Traditions help to express ideas that each society has collectively agreed to be of value. One could view this as an early form of his argument in <em>The Sacred Wood</em> about the value of different works that literary tradition provides. Eliot believes that all the literary texts ever written created one organic whole. Evaluated in relation to one another, as part of this tradition, they could be ordered in terms of their relative greatness.In the process of compiling <em>The Sacred Wood</em>, Eliot carefully revised his essays. Some of the revisions suggest a slight alteration in his views. For example, in the original version of the essay “The Local Flavour,” Eliot argues that the American critic Paul More should not have brought issues of morality to the work of literary criticism. In <em>The Sacred </em><i>Wood</i>, Eliot deletes that passage. As a result, the essay sits much better with his argument that there are clear relations between literature and culture, including religion and morality.<a href=\"#m-en-151\" title=\" David Huisman, “Title and Subject in The Sacred Wood,” in Essays in Criticism (1989) XXXIX (3): 217–233.\">1</a>Careful editing helped Eliot to integrate a broad range of influences and ideas in <em>The Sacred Wood</em>.

If you examine any of Shakespeare’s more successful tragedies, you will find that the state of mind of Lady Macbeth walking in her sleep has been communicated to you by a skillful accumulation of imagined sensory impressions; the words of Macbeth on hearing of his wife’s death strike us as if, given the sequence of events, these words were automatically released by the last event in the series.

    "content": "One aspect of <em>The Sacred Wood</em> that has generally stayed in the shadow of these major themes is Eliot’s focus on perception. He believes that perception—helping the reader to see things as they truly are—is essential to poetry. Perception is the key to contemplation of reality, which Eliot regards as the highest purpose of poetry. Eliot ends the first essay in the book, “The Perfect Critic,” with a discussion of the end purpose of poetry, which he calls “a pure contemplation.”<a href=\"#m-en-251\" title=\" Eliot, Sacred Wood, 12.\">5</a>He resumes that discussion in the final two essays of <em>The Sacred Wood</em>, “Blake” and “Dante”. In those essays, Eliot describes Blake’s and Dante’s backgrounds and the cultural context in which they were working. He looks at the role that culture played in their poetry and how successful that poetry was in leading the reader into a state of contemplation. Eliot argues that William Blake’s poetry suffered because he created his own <a data-id=\"1864\" data-type=\"Term\">mythologies.</a> Those mythologies weren't familiar to his readers, so they made his poetry harder to understand. If Blake had used a religious and mythological framework that was already known to his readers, Eliot says, it would have allowed him to concentrate on “the problems of the poet.”<a href=\"#m-en-252\" title=\" Eliot, Sacred Wood, 134.\">6</a>Dante, in contrast, writing in medieval Italy, benefited from a theological framework that spread through all of life, according to Eliot. As a poet, he was able to unify the cultural beliefs of his time with the realities of life itself. That is what allowed Dante to offer a vision of life that leads the reader into a state of pure contemplation.In <em>The Sacred Wood</em> Eliot seems to suggest that a society with a strong degree of cultural and moral unity is most conducive to producing great works of literature. Taken out of the context of literature, this discussion of intellectual culture can be tied to political theories that promote ethnic/cultural sameness. Later in his life, Eliot did voice some troubling political views; in the 1930s, he made a number of anti-Semitic comments that he later regretted. As a result, critics have tended to overlook his treatment of religion and theology within literary <a data-id=\"1841\" data-type=\"Term\">aesthetics.</a>",

    "content": "T. S. Eliot revised his essays before he included them in <em>The Sacred Wood</em>. The work doesn’t have a single, overarching plan, but those revisions did allow a set of themes and concepts to develop over the course of the book.In his introduction, Eliot suggests some—although not all—of those themes. He begins by quoting from the nineteenth-century English poet and critic <a data-id=\"10440\" data-type=\"Person\">Matthew Arnold.</a> Arnold praises the intellectual richness of ancient Greece and the Elizabethan age, and then goes on to lament the comparative lack of intellectual content in the work of the <a data-id=\"1875\" data-type=\"Term\">Romantic</a> poets of nineteenth-century England. Building on that, Eliot argues that it is the responsibility of the literary critic “to preserve tradition—where a good tradition exists.” This involves examining the literature of the past <em>and </em>the present with the same critical mind in order to reveal the best of both. Eliot writes in this introduction that when critics do this, it is easier for creativity to flourish.Eliot develops those initial comments more thoroughly in some essays in <i>The Sacred Wood</i> than in others. His concept of tradition is clearest in the essay, “Tradition and the Individual Talent.” He explores the roles of critic and poet in “The Perfect Critic” and in five essays gathered together as “The Imperfect Critic.” In essays on Dante (“Dante”) and <a data-id=\"10466\" data-type=\"Person\">Shakespeare</a> (“Hamlet and His Problems”), he examines the relationship between creativity and the broader intellectual culture.Other essays in the book are not so easily linked to Eliot’s key themes. Some deal with obscure authors, like <a data-id=\"10458\" data-type=\"Person\">Philip Massinger,</a> a lesser-known contemporary of Shakespeare’s. Others introduce literary concepts that are difficult to define. These subjects make Eliot’s arguments more challenging to follow than he may have thought.",

He emphasizes the importance of a culture’s philosophical, religious and moral frameworks.Eliot wrote <em>The Sacred Wood</em> in London after <a data-id=\"1879\" data-type=\"Term\">World War I.</a> In the aftermath of the horrors of that war, his comments can be understood as a reaction against the impressionistic, emotional, and individualistic tendencies of Romanticism in nineteenth-century poetry, and as a useful argument for building a rich intellectual culture. <em>The Sacred Wood</em> makes only a few proposals for what would be an ideal intellectual culture and contains no obvious ethnically or politically prejudiced content.However, in the 1930s, Eliot publicly expressed views that seemed to lean toward the political ideology and <a data-id=\"1844\" data-type=\"Term\">anti-Semitism</a> of the <a data-id=\"1877\" data-type=\"Term\">Third Reich.</a> Many of Eliot’s peers and critics found Eliot’s cultural politics difficult. Then the atrocities of the <a data-id=\"1858\" data-type=\"Term\">Holocaust</a> during <a data-id=\"1880\" data-type=\"Term\">World War II</a> led some people, even as early as the 1940s, to view Eliot’s cultural ideas as not simply indefensible, but actually immoral.What certain critics have seen as instances of prejudice has affected Eliot’s reputation. It can be difficult for modern readers to make allowances for his narrow cultural vision, even in its early form. Many of today’s readers have found Eliot’s cultural politics unforgiveable, given the multiculturalism of the late twentieth century—and the belief that a range of different beliefs and ethnicities can be accommodated within a single society. Others interested in Eliot’s <a data-id=\"1842\" data-type=\"Term\">Anglo-Catholicism</a> have been unable to reconcile the same elements with a recognizable form of Christianity.Some critics have dismissed Eliot’s poetry altogether because of his perceived prejudices. Yet others have ignored his problematic cultural politics in favor of exploring his poetry dispassionately. <a data-id=\"10463\" data-type=\"Person\">Christopher Ricks</a> and <a data-id=\"10451\" data-type=\"Person\">Anthony Julius</a> are among the contemporary critics who have analyzed and criticized Eliot’s <a data-id=\"1844\" data-type=\"Term\">anti-Semitism</a> while, at the same time, offering complex literary interpretations of his poetry.<a href=\"#m-en-271\" title=\" Christopher Ricks, T.

Eliot’s contemporaries, like <a data-id=\"10472\" data-type=\"Person\">Virginia Woolf</a> and other members of the <a data-id=\"1845\" data-type=\"Term\">Bloomsbury Group,</a> were involved in this work. But people in academic circles warmly received Eliot’s belief that a “scientific” literary mind was important. Soon after the publication of <em>The Sacred Wood</em>, Eliot became established as the critic whom university academics liked best.One of the long-term effects of Eliot’s work has been the gradual establishment of literary criticism as an academic discipline. <a data-id=\"10460\" data-type=\"Person\">Louis Menand</a> points out that Eliot’s success may be partly explained by his seizing of a cultural “moment … when the sort of freelance, journal-based criticism practiced by members of the Bloomsbury Group was being displaced by a new, university-based type: the criticism of the academic with an interest in the condition of contemporary culture.”<a href=\"#m-en-391\" title=\" Louis Menand, Discovering Modernism: T.

Although journal-based literary criticism still goes on, since 1917 there has been a strong shift towards academic criticism. Today, most highly regarded critics are professors, rather than independent poets or artists. Although people have generally accepted this takeover by academics as being normal in our contemporary literary culture, some believe it has not been a good thing because it has cut off the world of literature from culture at large. Eliot is sometimes held responsible for this change.",

    "content": "<em>The Sacred Wood</em> had a strong influence on the <a data-id=\"1863\" data-type=\"Term\">modernist</a> movement in literature. Eliot’s ideas attracted a great number of twentieth-century poets who aspired to follow his new principles for literary achievement. In addition, the literary <a data-id=\"1841\" data-type=\"Term\">aesthetics</a> that Eliot develops in <em>The Sacred Wood</em> became fundamental to <a data-id=\"1866\" data-type=\"Term\">New Criticism</a>—one of the most important literary criticism movements in the twentieth century.In 1922, two years after the publication of <em>The Sacred Wood</em>, Eliot’s poem <em>The Waste Land</em> appeared in London to immediate acclaim. With its fragmented representation of experience and emotion, its use of multiple voices, and its near-constant references to art, religion, and philosophy, the poem both baffled and inspired its readers. Many felt <em>The Waste Land</em> brilliantly captured an historic “moment” of cultural confusion in Europe after <a data-id=\"1879\" data-type=\"Term\">World War I.</a> The poem built on the success of <em>The Sacred Wood</em> and helped establish Eliot as an authority in the world of literary criticism.Few, if any, major twentieth-century poets writing in English could claim not to have been influenced by Eliot in some way. Several poets explicitly accepted Eliot’s belief that poetry should be impersonal—that it should find emotion in the poem itself, rather than in the personal experience of the poet. The American poet <a data-id=\"10448\" data-type=\"Person\">Hart Crane</a> was a clear example of someone whom Eliot heavily influenced. According to the modernist scholar Charles <a data-id=\"10449\" data-type=\"Person\">Altieri,</a> “Crane … realized as early as 1919 that [modern poetry] would have to go ‘through’ Eliot … ‘I would apply as much of his erudition and technique as I can absorb.’” Other important twentieth-century poets, such as <a data-id=\"10441\" data-type=\"Person\">W. H. Auden,</a> <a data-id=\"10453\" data-type=\"Person\">David Jones,</a> and <a data-id=\"10457\" data-type=\"Person\">Robert Lowell,</a> made similar statements about Eliot’s immediate influence on their own work.<a href=\"#m-en-401\" title=\" Charles Altieri, “Eliot’s impact on twentieth-century Anglo-American poetry,” in The Cambridge Companion to T. S. Eliot, ed. A David Moody (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994), 190–191.\">2</a> Clearly, Eliot not only had a significant impact on his contemporaries and his followers, but he has also continued to influence writers through the work of the many poets who took up his aesthetic principles.The scholars most identified with <em>The Sacred Wood</em> are the literary critics who led the New Criticism movement. The Cambridge academic critics <a data-id=\"10462\" data-type=\"Person\">I. A. Richards</a> and F. R. <a data-id=\"10456\" data-type=\"Person\">Leavis</a> were both dedicated disciples of <em>The Sacred Wood</em> and crucial to the emergence of the New Criticism. From Eliot’s literary principles, such as impersonality, integrity, and the <a data-id=\"1869\" data-type=\"Term\">objective correlative,</a> the New Criticism developed an analytical, text-based approach to literary analysis.In the 1980s, <a data-id=\"1868\" data-type=\"Term\">New Historicism</a> replaced that movement. It emphasized the need to examine how historical and cultural circumstances influenced texts, rather than treating poems as independent works with their own integrity. The last 20 years have seen still another change, with <a data-id=\"1867\" data-type=\"Term\">New Formalism</a> emerging—a movement more closely aligned with Eliot’s belief that form, detachment, and literary achievement are important. These waves of literary style and criticism suggest that, although <i>The Sacred Wood</i> is no longer a frequent reference point in literary debates, Eliot’s concepts of impersonality and integrity endure as jumping-off points for the central questions of contemporary poetry.",

    "content": "Nowadays, both theologians and literary scholars see value in <em>The Sacred Wood</em>. Among theologians, Rowan Williams, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, is perhaps the most important living scholar tackling the themes of <em>The Sacred Wood</em> and Eliot’s work in general. For Williams, Eliot’s theory of tradition and his view that individual personality should be sacrificed (in order to create something greater) are both related to Eliot’s Anglican beliefs and his theological identity.In the essay “Tradition and the Individual Talent,” Eliot sets out a formula for the natural ordering of poetic tradition and the necessary surrender of the poet to that tradition. He wrote this essay in 1919, eight years before his conversion to <a data-id=\"1842\" data-type=\"Term\">Anglo-Catholicism.</a> But Williams views Eliot’s concept of surrender as both literary and spiritual. He sees this notion as being as essential to Eliot’s literary views as it would eventually be to his religious life.<a href=\"#m-en-411\" title=\" Rowan Williams, Dostoevsky: Language, Faith, and Fiction (Waco: Baylor University Press, 2008), 71.\">3</a> In both cases, the views of the individual are less important than the judgments of tradition.Eliot is only one among a great number of influences on Rowan Williams. Nonetheless, his theory of tradition certainly has an influence on Williams’ own understanding of Church tradition. It has influenced Williams’ views on the shifts and conflicts within the Anglican world. Like literature, the Church forms a whole made up of many individual parts. It has had to retain its integrity as the Church while absorbing many changes to the way Christianity is understood and practiced. Although Eliot may not have originally intended for his work to be interpreted in this way, his sympathy towards religious and moral culture can be seen in <em>The Sacred Wood</em>. Together with Eliot’s eventual conversion to Anglicanism, this suggests that the author may not have been surprised or unhappy with where and how people are now discussing his work.Within the world of literary scholarship, people such as <a data-id=\"10454\" data-type=\"Person\">Hugh Kenner</a> and <a data-id=\"10446\" data-type=\"Person\">Ronald Bush</a> have been major contributors to modern-day interpretations and appreciations of Eliot’s life and work. <a data-id=\"10463\" data-type=\"Person\">Christopher Ricks</a> and <a data-id=\"10444\" data-type=\"Person\">Harold Bloom</a> have also done crucial work in rehabilitating Eliot’s reputation as a canonical poet. To be part of the literary canon, an author’s work must be considered to be among the most central works produced in their time. Ricks and Bloom have also made it clear that Eliot was a key force behind the flourishing of twentieth-century poetry in English.The British attorney <a data-id=\"10451\" data-type=\"Person\">Anthony Julius,</a> best known as the legal representative of Diana, Princess of Wales, during her divorce proceedings with Prince Charles in 1996, made his mark on the scholarly world by writing about Eliot. His work confronted the issue of Eliot’s <a data-id=\"1844\" data-type=\"Term\">anti-Semitism,</a> while also arguing that anti-Semitism had provided material for his great achievements as a poet.<a href=\"#m-en-412\" title=\" Anthony Julius, T. S. Eliot, anti-Semitism, and literary form (London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2003).\">4</a>Charles <a data-id=\"10449\" data-type=\"Person\">Altieri</a> is another important supporter of Eliot’s <a data-id=\"1870\" data-type=\"Term\">poetics.</a> In the 1980s, a new school of literary criticism, New Historicism, emerged. This school displaced New Criticism and, at the same time, many scholars who had been heavily influenced by Eliot’s writings. As a result, Eliot’s literary theories fell out of favor. But Altieri defended Eliot. Although Altieri is less a disciple of Eliot than a scholar of American <a data-id=\"1863\" data-type=\"Term\">modernist</a> and <a data-id=\"1872\" data-type=\"Term\">postmodernist</a> poetics, he belongs to a school of literary scholars eager to reclaim Eliot in terms of the current trends in literary criticism, such as gender studies and postmodernist interpretation.Scholars are now offering new readings of Eliot’s work based on the issues that occupy them. Such studies are not likely to pay a lot of attention to <em>The Sacred Wood</em>, but they have still contributed to the gradual rehabilitation of Eliot’s contribution to literary theory.",

Eliot’s status as one of the greatest poets in the twentieth century means that people will continue to explore his poetry and criticism. His influence on the development of twentieth-century literature means that core works like <em>The Sacred Wood</em> will still be used as a resource for understanding Eliot himself. Anyone interested in twentieth-century literature will want to investigate Eliot’s intellectual development, his motivations and hopes, and his literary principles and religious convictions.Moreover, <em>The Sacred Wood</em> is, in itself, a thoroughly readable and remarkable literary text. Despite the criticisms made of Eliot, it continues to engage its readers as a work of literature. With its direct style, lyrical precision, and intellectual breadth it remains an absorbing, even beautiful text, appealing to those who have any kind of interest in literature and writing. Regardless of the fact that the influence of Eliot’s literary theory may be greater at some times than at others, <em>The Sacred Wood</em> will continue to reward anyone who is keen to explore his writing. It shows the poet as an ambitious young man of letters, determined to develop his creative and critical voice.",

    "content": "Some critics have come to see T. S. Eliot’s <em>The Sacred Wood</em> as holding a <a data-id=\"1846\" data-type=\"Term\">canonical</a> place in the study of literary modernism—as among the most central works produced in his time. The text is crucial to an understanding of the <a data-id=\"1841\" data-type=\"Term\">aesthetics</a> of that movement and its evolution through the twentieth century. At the same time, other critics and scholars often view <em>The Sacred Wood</em> as a work of literature in its own right, and those interested in the personal and spiritual insights that it contains frequently study it. A recent essay by American critic Anthony Domestico summarizes the text’s central importance:“It is fascinating to see Eliot work through his interests in poetic impersonality and the poet’s relation to tradition, interests that would prove so important to modernist achievement in the 1920s. Just as valuable, however, is the sense that, in <em>The Sacred Wood</em>, we see a critic growing into his voice, marshaling his myriad half-formed thoughts into arresting phrases and memorable aesthetic judgments.”<a href=\"#m-en-421\" title=\" Anthony Domestico, “The Sacred Wood,” The Modernism Lab at Yale University, accessed August 29, 2014, http://modernism.research.yale.edu/wiki/index.php/The_Sacred_Wood\">1</a>In considering the current treatment of <em>The Sacred Wood</em>, it is important to bear in mind, too, that the original text comprised 13 essays of literary criticism. They were not all groundbreaking. Yet several essays proved to be particularly influential, notably “Tradition and the Individual Talent” and “Hamlet and His Problems.” Many readers may now read those more influential essays in the 1951 volume <em>Selected Essays</em> without even being aware of <em>The Sacred Wood</em>.",

    "content": "Of the original set of essays, “Tradition and the Individual Talent” is the most influential, as well as the most widely read and discussed. Eliot’s analysis of the individual writer’s relationship to literary tradition has also been part of broader intellectual conversations. In addition, his <a data-id=\"1842\" data-type=\"Term\">Anglo-Catholicism</a> is of ongoing interest to the Church. <a data-id=\"1876\" data-type=\"Term\">Theologians</a> and religious biographers have frequently discussed the essay, using it as a way of illustrating the struggle that individuals can have to reconcile the Church’s tradition and authority with their own religious beliefs.The second chapter of Rupert Shortt’s biography of Rowan Williams is called “Tradition and the Individual Talent.”<a archbishop=\"\" biography=\"\" canterbury=\"\" href=\"#m-en-431\" of=\"\" rule:=\"\" s=\"\" the=\"\" title=\" Rupert Shortt, Rowan\">2</a> By using this title, Shortt underpins his account of Williams’ religious development with Eliot’s concept of a living tradition that comprises all the monuments of the past. Shortt quietly builds a connection between the “great difficulties and responsibilities” that writers take on when they write a poem and the great burden that Church leaders take on when they take vows of fidelity to the Church. All of this is suggested without even mentioning Eliot’s name.Such references show the extent to which “Tradition and the Individual Talent,” as well as <em>The Sacred Wood</em> itself, have been absorbed into contemporary intellectual culture. And the reasons for mentioning Eliot may be personal, professional, or political. As controversial as Eliot’s later work has become, the central ideas of <em>The Sacred Wood</em> are still rich and admired enough that allusions to it can carry a weight similar to that of <a data-id=\"10466\" data-type=\"Person\">William Shakespeare</a> or the Bible. Rather than presenting a direct challenge to any one school of thought, <em>The Sacred Wood</em> serves as a reminder both of the importance of tradition and of the value in contributing to it—as Eliot himself set out to do.",

    "content": "Over the past few decades, literary criticism and teaching have been concerned with the question of canonization. This is the process by which certain works achieve the status of “classics” or “great books.” The word “canonization” itself suggests a fairly traditional model, and the works of white men have dominated the traditional canon. As such, people have criticized the canon as elitist—promoting, for instance, white authors instead of minority ones, and male writers instead of female writers. In doing so, its critics say that it ignores a huge amount of literary achievement.As styles of literary criticism that emphasize the importance of external influences on creativity have emerged, scholars have increasingly tried to evaluate texts bearing in mind the possible influence of the social, cultural, and historical contexts in which they were written. They have often sought to elevate non-canonical voices, such as those of women and ethnic minorities, to a canonical status. But critics such as <a data-id=\"10444\" data-type=\"Person\">Harold Bloom</a> and <a data-id=\"10463\" data-type=\"Person\">Christopher Ricks</a> have taken up arms against the emergence of cultural, social, and <a data-id=\"1871\" data-type=\"Term\">post-colonial</a> criticism of the historic literary canon. They argue that it is important to isolate the literary elements of literature from those outside concerns.In the context of this debate, Eliot’s determination to consider “the problem of the integrity of poetry”<a href=\"#m-en-441\" title=\" T. S. Eliot, The Sacred Wood: Essays on Poetry and Criticism (London: Faber &amp; Faber, 1997), x.\">3</a> has been presented as evidence to support the traditional canon. So too has Eliot’s desire to develop an analytical and purely literary method of criticism. His concept of tradition also contributes to the canonization debates, because it suggests literature itself will resolve the question of what is, and is not, great literature. In general, Eliot saw himself as an opponent of liberal <a data-id=\"1874\" data-type=\"Term\">progressivism.</a> He believed that an attitude of “progress for the sake of progress” was misguided and that it was important to recognize the best attributes of the past and to preserve them.The arguments in <em>The Sacred Wood</em> were not intended to address the complexities of contemporary cultural and religious conflict—and thus are not equipped to do so. Eliot’s own cultural politics and occasional <a data-id=\"1844\" data-type=\"Term\">anti-Semitic</a> remarks are now well known enough to invite a tide of criticism of his ideas and his writing. This means that even those critics who champion Eliot as a canonical writer tend to be cautious when talking about his literary theories, including the ideas discussed in <em>The Sacred Wood</em>. It would be unusual for <em>The Sacred Wood</em> to be championed as being able, on its own, to answer our present literary and cultural problems. But it continues to be one of many resources that are used as arguments for the preservation of a flourishing literary tradition.",

It has been mainly been used for literary exploration. But, at the same time, certain arguments in the work reflect Eliot’s later interest in cultural politics and his conversion to <a data-id=\"1842\" data-type=\"Term\">Anglo-Catholicism.</a> Eliot’s concept of tradition in <em>The Sacred Wood</em> demonstrates a great respect for the past—a belief that the past has greater value than the novelties of the present. From this attitude, it is possible to see how Eliot’s later writing would grow. Here are the seeds of Eliot’s doubts about the ideology of <a data-id=\"1862\" data-type=\"Term\">liberalism</a> and the <a data-id=\"1859\" data-type=\"Term\">hubris</a> of “progress” that characterizes his later writings about cultural politics.The literary world now often regards Eliot’s political views as problematic, believing that they tended towards <a data-id=\"1850\" data-type=\"Term\">communism</a> and <a data-id=\"1855\" data-type=\"Term\">fascism.</a> Scholars of political thought, however, have continued to debate the issue and have frequently painted a more moderate picture.

    "content": "One area where scholars and others may further develop the core ideas of <em>The Sacred Wood</em> involves Eliot’s concept of “tradition” as a living, organically ordered sum of all that has come before. In <em>The Sacred Wood</em>, Eliot’s concept of tradition relates essentially to a poetic tradition. This is “a living whole of all the poetry that has ever been written,”<a href=\"#m-en-461\" title=\" T. S. Eliot, The Sacred Wood: Essays on Poetry and Criticism (London: Faber &amp; Faber, 1997), 44.\">6</a> constantly altered by the addition of new poems and forming a natural order based on the greatness of each poem’s achievement.This concept, however, is easily extended beyond literature to other intellectual traditions, particularly philosophy, theology and religion. Recent work within the philosophy of religion has explored what a tradition actually is. It has also examined how change occurs when continuity is required. Western <a data-id=\"1848\" data-type=\"Term\">Christianity</a> is a good example. The Church in the West has changed a great deal over the centuries. Groups have broken away to form new religious bodies. Aspects of Church practice has been criticized and reformed. And yet the tradition of the Church has continued. In the context of these discussions, Eliot’s treatment of tradition and intellectual culture may become a resource for further study in philosophy, theology, and history.Since the appearance of <em>The Sacred Wood</em>, the academic world has become much more diverse. It has also become much more suspicious of traditional and <a data-id=\"1857\" data-type=\"Term\">hierarchical</a> definitions of culture. Many readers will reject Eliot’s argument that an individual must be knowledgeable about the literature of the past if he or she wants to be a great writer or critic. The cultural changes that have occurred since <em>The Sacred Wood</em> was written, particularly the development of multiculturalism, will affect people’s assessments of whether the book is still relevant. But it’s still an engaging and challenging read. That alone may be enough to make <em>The Sacred Wood</em> a classic.",

    "content": "The concept of <i>integrity</i> refers to the relationship between the part and the whole. A work of art integrates with all the other works of art that have come before it and is understood in relation to those other works. That concept of integrity is key to Eliot’s understanding of tradition. But he also uses integrity as a way of evaluating individual works of literature. Every element of a creative work, he says, helps to shape its final form—and its final form should be reflected in its parts. In <em>The Sacred Wood</em>, Eliot analyzes the work of different writers, using integrity as a measure of a work’s literary value. He had learned the concepts of tradition and integrity as part of his philosophical training. What was original was the way that he applied them to literature.It’s also important to understand what Eliot saw as being the end purpose of poetry: by depicting things as they really are, it can help readers to contemplate reality and thereby live a more fulfilling life. The things depicted can be situations, objects, or chains of events. One example Eliot gives is the way in which Shakespeare uses the image of Lady Macbeth walking in her sleep and trying to scrub imaginary specks of blood off her hands. That is a concrete image, but it conveys profound emotional and intellectual content, which the reader can perceive. This emphasis on <i>perception</i>—what the reader perceives—is key. Eliot cites as an example <a data-id=\"10449\" data-type=\"Person\">Dante’s</a> <em>Divine Comedy</em>. This work transforms the emotional and intellectual material that makes up Christian theology, philosophy, and history into a complex and complete universe, which the reader can then perceive.But perhaps Eliot’s most complex concept in <em>The Sacred Wood</em> is that of <i>i</i><i>mpersonality</i>—a concept based on the relationship between the artist and the work of art. Eliot argued that poetry should not be a vehicle for expressing a poet’s emotions. Instead, the <em>poet </em>should be a vehicle for transforming emotions and experiences into works of art. A poem should be something truly original, from which all personal emotion has been removed. At that point, the poem is impersonal: it is its own being with its own emotion. The poet’s personality has been sacrificed.",

    "content": "Eliot originally wrote the essays in <em>The Sacred Wood</em> as separate works of literary criticism. As a result, one can read each essay as an independent piece of commentary and thought. For that reason, Eliot’s themes do not appear in a logically structured way. They emerge from the essays organically when the book is read as an extended argument. The poetic and metaphorical qualities of Eliot’s writing are likely to enrich the reader’s appreciation of these ideas.The theme of <i>tradition</i> is explained in the essay “Tradition and the Individual Talent.” Here, Eliot argues that the poet must be deeply aware of the literary achievements of the past. These form a natural order that will be altered by the poet’s new work. In Eliot’s view, the critic’s role is to preserve tradition. By doing so the critic can help contemporary poets see how their work relates to the great body of literary tradition.Eliot also explores the theme of <i>impersonalit</i>y in “Tradition and the Individual Talent.” He argues that the poet must surrender himself to the greatness of literary tradition. This involves a sacrifice of his or her own personality: poets sacrifice the fleeting preoccupations and emotions that affect only them in order to reflect the fundamental realities of life.Many of the essays in <em>The Sacred Wood</em> discuss particular writers, from well-known authors like <a data-id=\"10466\" data-type=\"Person\">Shakespeare</a> and <a data-id=\"10443\" data-type=\"Person\">William Blake</a> to less well-known ones, like Algernon <a data-id=\"10470\" data-type=\"Person\">Charles Swinburne</a> and <a data-id=\"10458\" data-type=\"Person\">Philip Massinger.</a> Eliot uses the concept of <i>integrity</i> as a basis for analyzing and evaluating these writers. An excellent poem or play demonstrates integrity when its different elements all help the reader understand the poem as a whole.Finally, the theme of<i> perception</i> is developed in the essay “The Perfect Critic.” If a poet is conscious of poetic tradition, and a poem has both integrity and impersonality, then that poem can lead the reader to true contemplation of reality—of things as they really are. In Eliot’s view, that is the ultimate purpose of poetry.In <em>The Sacred Wood</em>, these themes come together in a vision of poetic tradition. Eliot demands that poets and critics be faithful to tradition and preserve it through study. He insists that contemporary literature should be measured according to the achievements of the past.",

    "content": "<i>The Federalist Papers</i> are a collection of 85 essays, published in eighteenth-century New York, that together argue for a strong and active central government. A new US Constitution had been presented by a Constitutional Convention to the 13 individual states for ratification. <i>The Federalist Papers</i> argue in favor of ratification and against the status quo under the existing <a id=\"m-ref165\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"2903\" data-type=\"Term\">Articles of Confederation.</a> Two of the authors of <i>The Federalist Papers</i>—Hamilton and Madison—were delegates at the Convention.The Articles of Confederation, which effectively formed the first Constitution of the United States, had been ratified in 1781 and provided for a loose confederation (alliance) of self-governing states and a weak national legislature (the body that passes laws). That arrangement was designed explicitly in opposition to the strong central government of Great Britain, and in the context of the War of Independence from Britain that took place between 1775 and 1783. The newly independent United States of America therefore had a natural suspicion of centralized government. In some ways it would seem logical for there to be natural hostility toward a new Constitution that looked to put more power into the hands of a single central power.From the perspective of the authors of <i>The Federalist Papers</i>, however, the Articles of Confederation had failed to achieve political and economic security and would likely fail to hold the union together. The essays drew on European <a id=\"m-ref166\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"2915\" data-type=\"Term\">Enlightenment</a> and <a id=\"m-ref167\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"2934\" data-type=\"Term\">republican</a> philosophy in considering which form of government most effectively balanced individual rights and the broader interests of society. The Enlightenment was a seventeenth- and eighteenth-century movement that emphasized progress through science and reason. Republican philosophy was in favor of government that represented the rights and needs of the public. It was argued by some that the American political experiment under the Articles of Confederation had proved that too much liberty meant that an orderly and prosperous society could not exist. The authors tried to show how the United States could both retain state autonomy and still protect personal liberty through strong government.These themes are reflected in the titles of some of the papers:<li>“The Insufficiency of the Present Confederation to Preserve the Union”</li><li>“Advantage of the Union in Respect to Economy in Government”</li><li>“Concerning Dangers from Foreign Force and Influence”</li><li>“Concerning Dangers from Dissensions Between the States”</li><li>“Concerning the General Power of Taxation”</li>It is not agreed whether the essays directly influenced the ratification of the new Constitution. While their initial aim was to persuade the state of New York to ratify, that state did not, in fact, do so until after nine other states had ratified. At least nine states needed to ratify before the Constitution could be passed into law. But even so, it is clear that the authors saw their vision realized. The new Constitution provided for a stronger <a id=\"m-ref168\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"2917\" data-type=\"Term\">federal</a> government—that is, one in which power is shared between local and national layers of government through defined institutions—with a chief executive (president), courts, and powers of taxation.",

    "content": "<i>The Federalist Papers</i> are a collection of essays published in New York between October 1787 and August 1788. Written by three important political figures in the country’s early history, they were designed to persuade fellow countrymen to accept a new set of supreme laws, the <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref1\" data-id=\"2906\" data-type=\"Term\">Constitution.</a> These authors—Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay—were convinced that the existing Constitution (the <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref2\" data-id=\"2903\" data-type=\"Term\">Articles of Confederation</a>) was no longer fit for purpose.The authors were already important national figures. James Madison had penned the first draft of the Constitution himself. Alexander Hamilton had been an aide to future President <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref3\" data-id=\"11111\" data-type=\"Person\">George Washington</a> during the American Revolution/<a data-score=\"7\" id=\"m-ref4\" data-id=\"2945\" data-type=\"Term\">War of Independence</a> (1775–83) and went on to establish the <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref5\" data-id=\"2913\" data-type=\"Term\">Department of the Treasury.</a> John Jay had worked as both a politician and a diplomat, and had founded the country’s judicial (court) system. As such, all three can claim to be “<a data-score=\"5\" id=\"m-ref6\" data-id=\"2919\" data-type=\"Term\">Founding Fathers”</a> of the United States.<i>The Federalist Papers</i> are hugely interesting historically, but they are also fascinating because of their literary techniques of persuasion. They have played a central role in helping people understand American legal and constitutional issues and the relationship between efficient government and economic stability,<a href=\"#m-en-4\">2</a> and in debates on <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref7\" data-id=\"2912\" data-type=\"Term\">democratization</a>—the process of making countries more democratic—and <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref8\" data-id=\"2922\" data-type=\"Term\">human rights.</a><i>The Federalist Papers</i> offer a sophisticated take on the principles of good governance. The newspaper publication of these articles, from late 1787 to summer 1788, had a significant impact on American political and legal opinion at the time. Subsequent book editions aroused great interest as well.The essays argued for a number of political principles:\n\t<li><a data-score=\"5\" id=\"m-ref9\" data-id=\"2934\" data-type=\"Term\">Republicanism,</a> a system in which the people are sovereign (the ultimate power) and government acts on their behalf.</li>\n\t<li><a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref10\" data-id=\"2917\" data-type=\"Term\">Federalism,</a> a system in which sovereignty (lawmaking power) is shared between different levels of government.</li>\n\t<li><a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref11\" data-id=\"2937\" data-type=\"Term\">Separation of powers,</a> the division of powers between the executive (administrative), the legislative (lawmaking), and the judicial (court) branches of government. This separation is designed to create a check on executive power.</li>\n&nbsp;The fundamental principles of<i> The Federalist Papers</i> are also adaptable: they are referred to today in political and legal battles over international trade and Internet privacy.<a href=\"#m-en-5\">3</a> <i>The Federalist Papers</i> are a seminal text in political science, law, history, and philosophy.",

There is debate about his birth date, but he himself thought it was 1757. He was effectively orphaned at the age of 12 when his mother died of fever. Hamilton had already gained a reputation as a writer when, in 1772, at the age of 15, he left to complete his education in America with funds donated by fellow islanders. He first studied at Elizabethtown Academy in New Jersey and then at King’s College in New York (now Columbia University).James Madison was born into a wealthy, slave-owning plantation family in Virginia in 1751 and studied at the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). One of his teachers was <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref12\" data-id=\"11113\" data-type=\"Person\">John Witherspoon,</a> a specialist in the works of the Scottish <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref13\" data-id=\"2915\" data-type=\"Term\">Enlightenment,</a> a period in the eighteenth century when huge leaps in intellectual and scientific thinking took place. These ideas on political and economic freedoms influenced the American Revolutionary movement of 1775 to 1783 that led to the country’s independence from Britain.John Jay was born in 1745 to a wealthy New York City family of merchants and government officials. He was educated as a lawyer at King’s College before establishing a law practice and becoming engaged in politics.Despite these different family histories and personal circumstances, all three men shared a good education and an understanding of classical and modern political philosophy.Some scholars have argued that the writers’ family backgrounds explain their individual political leanings.

Though from extremely different family backgrounds, the authors were all educated at elite schools and were well versed in the Greek and Roman classics.

For example, in <i>Politics</i>, Aristotle argued that “man is by nature a political animal,”<a href=\"#m-en-9\">1</a> and in <i>Leviathan</i>, Hobbes suggested that in the absence of a strong government, society would be a “war of all against all.”<a href=\"#m-en-10\">2</a> Agreement about how much human nature was predetermined or timeless, however, was challenged by many other thinkers. These included <a id=\"m-ref31\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"11098\" data-type=\"Person\">David Hume,</a> who suggested that human nature reflected physical aspects that could exert an influence, and <a id=\"m-ref32\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"11100\" data-type=\"Person\">Immanuel Kant,</a> who thought that human society could achieve progress—and that human nature could therefore be improved—through education.The influence of these thinkers and others is acknowledged throughout the text.

    "content": "Classical political thought revolved around how the state could develop “the good life” for its citizens. Inquiries tend first to define what “the good life” actually means in social terms and then outline a plan to achieve it. The writers of <i>The Federalist Papers</i> were conscious of being part of a long-standing philosophical tradition. But they also thought they were doing something novel, adapting the ideals of philosophy to the practicalities of political negotiation and the specific problems created by the <a id=\"m-ref44\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"2912\" data-type=\"Term\">democratic</a> ideals of the new state. Chief among these was the dilemma of how to respect the principle of <a id=\"m-ref45\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"2927\" data-type=\"Term\">majority rule</a> (the principle that whatever a majority of citizens decide with regard to a voting issue should become law), while still ensuring that fundamental rights were respected for <i>all</i> citizens, especially ethnic and religious minorities.<a href=\"#m-en-14\">2</a> The idea that minorities can easily be persecuted in a democratic regime was crucial to their understanding of the purposes of government. And this influenced the writers’ decision to focus on limiting government power through a system of checks and balances.The authors approach these questions in a number of ways. In several of the essays they quote extensively from influential Greek, Roman, French, and English thinkers, including <a id=\"m-ref46\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"11092\" data-type=\"Person\">Cicero,</a> <a id=\"m-ref47\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"11105\" data-type=\"Person\">Montesquieu,</a> and <a id=\"m-ref48\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"11101\" data-type=\"Person\">John Locke.</a> The authors make use of historical references too. They talk about Athens and Rome, as well as about more recent political experiences in Great Britain and post-Independence America. This impressive philosophical and historical knowledge was then used to propose a stronger Constitution for the United States and to outline how the new document corrected existing problems with the Articles of Confederation.<a href=\"#m-en-15\">3</a>",

    "content": "The authors of <i>The Federalist Papers</i>—Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay—wanted radical political change. Facing the prospect of a ratification vote for the new US Constitution, they intended to use their essays to generate support for the pro-ratification cause. But <i>The Federalist Papers</i> are more than political propaganda or persuasion. They also act as a blueprint for government: how the new institutions will work, how they will interact, and how they will respond to society at large. In explaining the issues of how the Constitution would actually work and the political theory behind it, the authors seized more opportunities to persuade people that their plans were sound. They also responded to Anti-<a data-score=\"6\" id=\"m-ref51\" data-id=\"2918\" data-type=\"Term\">Federalist</a> fears regarding how people in “big” government could abuse their power and how this type of government might overstretch itself.<i>The Federalist Papers </i>make clear that the US has a unique opportunity to make decisions at an early stage in its political development. Either the states could support a strong Constitution and the future of America or they could accept the status quo. In the view of Hamilton, Madison, and Jay this meant instability, both internally and against the prospect of an external threat.",

Reading the Constitution itself does not explain how the checks and balances between the different branches of government prevent any one of them from becoming too powerful. But “Federalist Nos. 47–51” address the <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref56\" data-id=\"2937\" data-type=\"Term\">separation of powers</a> (dividing the role of lawmaking from the role of law enforcement) both in depth and with great nuance. The issue of tyranny (or abuse of power) was also implicit in discussions of how minority rights could be protected through representative government. Madison used “Federalist No. 10” to show that the causes of political factions or groups cannot be eradicated. Their effects, however, can be alleviated by enlarging the scope of the state to encompass a diversity of interest groups. This means that every faction has a reasonable expectation of political success, but none feels entitled to it.Beyond the value of explaining the Constitution to those voting either to ratify or to deny its passage, <i>The Federalist Papers</i> have played a crucial role in court judgments and continue to do so.

The question of human nature is evident in “Federalist No. 51:” “If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.”<a href=\"#m-en-26\">1</a>Here Madison links human nature to the need for the Constitution and at the same time notes why governments need to be governed themselves. This continues to be relevant today in considering the behavior of government and the balancing of individual freedoms against social justice.Unequal distribution of property wealth as a cause of division could easily be seen as an argument for a more equal distribution and so a more just society. But Madison was clear at the end of “Federalist No. 10” that an equal division of property would be an “improper or wicked project.” His purpose in this case is to argue for a “republican remedy” to such problems.",

    "content": "The Federalists were in favor of a new Constitution because, in their view, the Articles of Confederation had failed. The federal government was too weak. States had been given excessive power during the struggle against a centralized Britain and because of a fear of a “tyranny of the <a id=\"m-ref64\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"2944\" data-type=\"Term\">majority.”</a> This latter phrase summed up the fear that in a <a id=\"m-ref65\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"2911\" data-type=\"Term\">democracy</a> the majority view would simply drown out minority voices that actually needed to be heard. Under the Articles of Confederation, <a id=\"m-ref66\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"2905\" data-type=\"Term\">Congress</a> had no power to impose taxes, it could not draft troops for war, it could not control interstate commerce, states printed their own money, and the US government had no chief executive to enforce the laws it passed. The Federalists advocated stronger central government in response to this, and in order to forge a national identity.Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay’s<i> The Federalist Papers</i> proposed transferring certain specified powers, such as coining money and declaring war, from individual states to the central government. The central authority would be divided into three branches of government—the legislative (lawmaking), executive (putting laws into effect), and judicial (court) wings—and two houses of Congress—the <a id=\"m-ref67\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"2936\" data-type=\"Term\">Senate</a> and the <a id=\"m-ref68\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"2921\" data-type=\"Term\">House of Representatives.</a> A system of checks and balances between these branches and houses would safeguard against abuses of power. It was also proposed that states would retain full control over all areas not reserved for the central authority. There would, in addition, be some shared powers such as taxation and the courts.The benefits of political union form a core idea. In “Federalist No. 14,” Madison writes, “We have seen the necessity of the Union, as our bulwark against foreign danger, as the conservator of peace among ourselves, as the guardian of our commerce and other common interests, as the only substitute for those military establishments which have subverted the liberties of the Old World, and as the proper antidote for the diseases of faction, which have proved fatal to other popular governments, and of which alarming symptoms have been betrayed by our own.”<a href=\"#m-en-20\">1</a> Political union, therefore, was part of the project to forge a common American identity.The papers attempted to achieve a balance between the views of Hamilton, who reflected the commercial interests of New York, and the views of Madison, who understood the concerns of Virginia farmers about a powerful distant authority. Together, they believed they could express a vision for a cohesive nation without destroying the identity or autonomy of all the states.",

    "content": "The intellectual debate in eighteenth-century America was both political and philosophical. Competing interests had a stake in the outcome, including state legislators, judges, political parties, citizens, and businesses. <i>The Federalist Papers</i> are recognized as key writings on good governance and its intellectual foundations. But they represented only some of the competing interests of the day.Anti-Federalists used arguments from America’s “<a id=\"m-ref69\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"2919\" data-type=\"Term\">Founding Fathers,”</a> such as <a id=\"m-ref70\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"11112\" data-type=\"Person\">James Wilson.</a> Wilson argued that a government relying on the consent of the people to be legitimate needed its citizens to obey laws of their own free will and for them to have a natural attachment to the state. Anti-Federalists claimed that there therefore needed to be smaller local governments with which people could identify more easily.<a href=\"#m-en-21\">2</a>“Federalist No. 9” challenges this argument. Hamilton notes that his opponents <a id=\"m-ref71\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"11105\" data-type=\"Person\">cite Montesquieu</a> (a French <a id=\"m-ref72\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"2915\" data-type=\"Term\">Enlightenment</a> lawyer) when arguing for small republics. But Hamilton points out that most of the 13 states were already bigger than what Montesquieu recommended. Hamilton also suggests that the Anti-Federalist reading of Montesquieu was both selective and misleading. He quotes Montesquieu at length to show that he had, in fact, advocated a “confederacy”—“a convention by which several smaller states agree to become members of a larger one … A republic of this kind, able to withstand an external force, may support itself without any internal corruptions.”<a href=\"#m-en-22\">3</a>Other schools of thought were part of both Federalist and Anti-Federalist circles. <a id=\"m-ref73\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"2930\" data-type=\"Term\">Political conservatism</a> had a role in opposing the new US Constitution.

Some touch on why people need government and how a government can best match the social and psychological states of humankind.Madison’s view of human nature is an important secondary theme because it helps to explain why he believed a new Constitution was necessary. The United States was an overwhelmingly <a id=\"m-ref79\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"2932\" data-type=\"Term\">Protestant</a> nation with a rather pessimistic view of the human tendency to sin.

This he sees as potentially contrary to the common good. While Madison acknowledges a number of ways in which this might come about, he sees the unequal distribution of property as a fundamental cause. He was not opposed to such inequality, but proposed that a republican form of government based on elected representatives would ease its worst effects.",

    "content": "<i>The Federalist Papers</i> form a work that Hamilton, Madison, and Jay intended for multiple audiences and purposes. This is reflected in statements from the two men who wrote the great majority of the text. Alexander Hamilton, who conceived the project and wrote 60 percent of it, was known for his confidence and desire for greatness. It is unsurprising that he claimed that the authors looked “forward to remote futurity”—or what would happen in the future.<a href=\"#m-en-36\">7</a> On the other hand, Madison really did cement his own legacy by drafting the Constitution and serving as president. He wrote in 1825 that the book is “the most authentic exposition of the text of the Federal Constitution, as understood by the Body which accepted it.”<a href=\"#m-en-37\">8</a> This was meant to show that the work was primarily suited to understanding the Constitution in its original context, which narrows its applicability in other situations. Both authors were right, however, in that the text served its immediate purpose well and still continues to be relevant in the “remote futurity.”The role of <i>The Federalist Papers</i> in American jurisprudence (the science or philosophy of law) is established. But the US Constitution’s status as the oldest written Constitution still in force, and the fact that it served as an inspiration for subsequent democratic constitutions, means that <i>The Federalist Papers</i> are relevant to non-American contexts as well.<a href=\"#m-en-38\">9</a> They are also important in areas that are not purely political or philosophical, and are cited in economics,<a href=\"#m-en-39\">10</a> <a id=\"m-ref91\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"2935\" data-type=\"Term\">rhetoric,</a><a href=\"#m-en-40\">11</a> and other fields.Most of the text has been criticized in a way that is specific to North American political culture, but it has also been used in Latin American and other contexts, meaning that its application has extended beyond simply “remote futurity” to remote localities too.<a href=\"#m-en-41\">12</a>",

    "content": "Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay were aware that <i>The Federalist Papers</i> would attract a great deal of criticism. The essays took an open position in favor of adopting the new US Constitution and made no attempt to be objective. The authors were trying to persuade skeptical voters that adopting the Constitution was the best possible thing to do. They took the <a id=\"m-ref103\" data-score=\"99\" data-id=\"2918\" data-type=\"Term\">Federalist</a> title for their position and forced the opposition to become the Anti-Federalists (in spite of the pseudonym used in the quote above). In other words, this work was designed to attract and encourage critical debate. The entire text has been scrutinized in detail by political philosophers, judges, and citizens ever since.Anti-Federalists argued that <i>The Federalist Papers</i> made an unconvincing case for constitutional ratification. They thought that questions on the relationship between state and national governments were left unanswered and made light of real threats to personal and political liberties.Anti-Federalists also adopted pseudonyms in the fashion of the day. One Anti-Federalist calling himself “Cincinnatus” (after a Roman aristocrat) criticized the Federalist argument for a unified and strong central government on the ground that American colonial and Revolutionary experience showed that small, local government was the best system for ensuring freedom. He asked his readers, “Will anyone believe … that in twelve years we are to overthrow every system which reason and experience taught us right?”<a href=\"#m-en-47\">2</a> Anti-Federalists like Cincinnatus rejected the idea that the Articles of Confederation were not working and argued that, on the contrary, they were performing just as they were supposed to by keeping government small and local.",

Each time an essay was published in a newspaper, it attracted public comment and letters to the editor, and was often mentioned in an opponent’s response. Subsequent essays could therefore respond to critiques directly, making <i>The Federalist Papers</i> part of a political dialogue in which the reader could get a feel for both sides of the debate by reading just the one.Indeed, Anti-Federalist arguments were occasionally rejected explicitly. This is seen in the title of “Federalist No. 39”: “The Conformity of the Plan [Constitution] to Republican Principles: An Objection in Respect to the Powers of the Convention Examined.” This essay acknowledged the Anti-Federalist claim that the <a id=\"m-ref104\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"2908\" data-type=\"Term\">Constitutional Convention</a> (which met to revise the Articles of Confederation) was illegitimate because it went beyond what it was authorized to do.<a href=\"#m-en-48\">3</a> The Anti-Federalist fear was that centralized government would simply end up disregarding state power. Madison’s response was that the <a id=\"m-ref105\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"2936\" data-type=\"Term\">Senate</a> would reflect state interests and that the national government’s power would extend “to certain enumerated objects only, and [leave] to the several States a residuary and inviolable sovereignty over all other objects.”<a href=\"#m-en-49\">4</a> Any power that was not specified as belonging to the center would automatically fall to the states.While the authors did not give ground on the fundamental issues at stake, they did tailor their arguments to respond to the concerns of both critics and the wider voting public.

If not, they can be declared unconstitutional and invalidated.<a href=\"#m-en-64\">5</a>Those who belong to the judicial school of <a id=\"m-ref137\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"2941\" data-type=\"Term\">strict constructionism</a> argue that judges should declare laws invalid if they go beyond explicitly stated powers in the Constitution.<a href=\"#m-en-65\">6</a> This was a key argument made by lawyers and politicians opposed to the 2009 Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare,” as it is more commonly called), which was signed into law in 2010. The Act was made law in order to increase the quality and affordability of health care and reduce the number of uninsured people. But a heated debate continues over whether the government has the right to oblige US citizens to buy health insurance. Opponents argue that this directive is not a part of the Constitution and thereby exceeds the power given to <a id=\"m-ref138\" data-score=\"10\" data-id=\"2905\" data-type=\"Term\">Congress.</a> Supporters argue that the law can be passed under the constitutional authority given to Congress to regulate interstate commerce.<a href=\"#m-en-66\">7</a>The text can be used by either school of thought. Originalists can use the emphasis of “Federalist No. 42” on the value of political stability and the need for consistent application of the law.<a href=\"#m-en-67\">8</a> In contrast, “living constitutionalists” can appeal to “Federalist No. 84,” which notes that the Constitution expressly states that it can be amended to meet future needs.<a href=\"#m-en-68\">9</a>",

In the discipline of constitutional law, the text defines foundational principles, such as the separation of powers, republicanism, federalism, and constitutionalism itself.

Rather, it was textile production, especially cotton, control over a huge empire (India provided enormous amounts of cotton fibers) and a strong military that allowed Britain to achieve an unmatched hold over global markets. The cotton yarn and fabric was manufactured on new machine looms, powered by steam engines. This promoted the growth of factories and the cotton industry allowed rich merchants to amass huge profits, even while much of the population lived in misery. In the 1830s and 1840s those profits were often invested in railways that were being built, in coal mining and the growth of heavy industry.<a href=\"#m-en-44\">1</a>In <i>The Age of Revolution: Europe 1789–1848 </i>Hobsbawm argued that in France, meanwhile, the Revolution had an importance that went way far beyond the upheavals in other countries. This was for a number of reasons:\n\t<li>It took place in the most populated and powerful kingdom in Europe.</li>\n\t<li>It was a social revolution, not just a change in the form of government.</li>\n\t<li>It aimed to spread its ideals all around the world and had an influence on uprisings as far as Latin America and <a data-score=\"4\" id=\"m-ref111\" data-id=\"2981\" data-type=\"Term\">India.</a></li>\n\t<li>Its revolutionary government was soon pulled into a war against neighboring powers, especially Britain.

He witnessed first hand some great historical events and later wrote about these experiences in the memoir <i>Interesting Times</i>, published in 2002.<a data-id=\"1626\" data-type=\"note\">1</a>Hobsbawm was born in Alexandria, Egypt, in 1917 to Leopold and Nelly Hobsbaum. The family later became Hobsbawm due to a misspelling by a British consular official.<a data-id=\"1627\" data-type=\"note\">2</a> His parents were merchants of Central European Jewish descent and as a youth Hobsbawm lived in Vienna, Austria, and Berlin, Germany. But his parents had previously lived in London and spoke to Eric in English. Both of Hobsbawm’s parents had died by the time he was 14 and he and his sister were taken in by relatives. The young Eric taught English to help with money. When the <a data-score=\"5\" id=\"m-ref266\" data-id=\"2991\" data-type=\"Term\">Nazis</a> came to power in Germany in 1933, his relatives fled Berlin and Eric moved to London with them.

During <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref270\" data-id=\"3010\" data-type=\"Term\">World War II</a> he joined the British Army, serving in the Royal Engineers and the Educational Corps.

    "content": "In The Age of Revolution, Hobsbawm argues that between 1789 and 1848 two revolutions together changed the course of European history. He claims that the <a data-id=\"2982\" data-type=\"Term\">Industrial Revolution</a> in Britain and the <a data-id=\"2976\" data-type=\"Term\">French Revolution</a> that began in 1789 created the economic, political and social conditions that allowed capitalism (an economic system based on private enterprise and maximizing profit) and political liberalism (a political movement designed to encourage the freedom of the individual) to spread out from northwest Europe and transform the wider world.<a data-id=\"1630\" data-type=\"note\">5</a> Mixing fine detail with analysis on a grand scale, Hobsbawm explored the connections between the economic, social, political and ideological changes in this period. This set the scene for a trio of books on the <a data-id=\"2987\" data-type=\"Term\">“long 19th century”:</a> After <i>The Age of Revolution</i>: Europe 1789–1848 (published in 1962), came The Age of Capital: 1848–1875 (which appeared in 1975) and The Age of Empire: 1875–1914 (which was published in 1987).<a data-id=\"1631\" data-type=\"note\">6</a> All three books were seen as key works on nineteenth-century European history and were translated into 50 languages.<a data-id=\"1632\" data-type=\"note\">7</a> According to one reviewer, the trilogy belonged to “the mental furniture of educated Englishmen.”<a data-id=\"1633\" data-type=\"note\">8</a>Hobsbawm wanted to trace how the forces that created the modern world first emerged. On the one hand, the Industrial Revolution led to an explosion in the production of goods, setting free vast profits and unimaginable power. On the other hand it helped fuel new ways to exploit factory workers and others, creating bitter class conflict. In the same way, the French Revolution of 1789 had created visions of social justice and universal brotherhood. But it also led to new forms of rivalry between nations as well as some forms of political oppression, which laid the seeds for future conflict in France. Hobsbawm pointed to the double-edged nature of historical change. He saw the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth century as not only the birthplace of capitalism, with its basis in profit and private enterprise, but also of its political opponent, <a data-id=\"3002\" data-type=\"Term\">socialism,</a> which looked to create a more just and equal society. Studying this age of revolution helped Hobsbawm to explain why Europe was the way it was at the time of the book’s publication. But it also provided a promise for what Europe might become—a place where socialism might bring a fairer and more just society. Historical writing and personal political commitment always went hand in hand throughout Hobsbawm’s career.",

    "content": "There are three key arguments in Hobsbawm’s <i>The Age of Revolution</i>. First, he wanted to underline how this period from 1789 to 1848 created a sharp break from what went before. More conservative historians saw slow and gradual change, but Hobsbawm boldly stated that the British Industrial Revolution “forms the greatest transformation in human history since the remote times when men invented agriculture, metallurgy, writing, the city and the state.”<a href=\"#m-en-46\">3</a> The political crisis that broke out in France in 1789 was equally important, with the masses directly involved in political struggle. In the short-term the revolutionaries were not successful as the French Republic was overthrown in a military coup by <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref112\" data-id=\"11157\" data-type=\"Person\">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> in 1799. But they still handed down a powerful ideal to future generations: “the dream of equality, liberty and fraternity, and of the people rising in its majesty to shake off oppression.”<a href=\"#m-en-47\">4</a>Second, Hobsbawm looked to show that the “dual revolution” in France and Britain created a world that was favorable to the bourgeoisie. Political signs of this included the growth of <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref113\" data-id=\"2986\" data-type=\"Term\">liberalism</a> (mainly the freedom of the individual and <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref114\" data-id=\"2975\" data-type=\"Term\">free trade),</a> limits on the powers of the church, the ending of major economic controls, and more <a data-score=\"8\" id=\"m-ref115\" data-id=\"2999\" data-type=\"Term\">representative governments</a> with the people having a say in matters of policy via elected representatives.Careers that had previously been reserved for those of noble birth now opened up to people with talent, and a world that functioned based more on merit started to emerge. While these changes were presented as good for all citizens, they were most useful for the new bourgeois class who had the ability to get on in life.Thirdly, this important new position of the bourgeoisie seemed very insecure. If the period from 1789 to 1848 brought new terms like “factory,” “capitalist,” and “liberal,” it also threw up the words “<a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref116\" data-id=\"3002\" data-type=\"Term\">socialism,”</a> “strike,” and “<a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref117\" data-id=\"2993\" data-type=\"Term\">pauperism.”</a><a href=\"#m-en-48\">5</a> Such concepts led to the rise of the working class, who would soon begin thinking of their own interests and become a revolutionary force. The socialism that emerged in Britain and France in the 1830s and 1840s was different from previous movements that dreamt of justice or freedom. It did not look to the past, but to the future and was built on the idea of using the industrial economy for the benefit of all, rather than the profit of the few.",

    "content": "<i>The Age of Revolution</i> argues that the changes that took place in Britain and France in the late eighteenth century went on to create the modern world. Hobsbawm clearly shows what makes the modern era different from what went before. In this sense, the book is a good case study for thinking about “periodization”—the beginnings and endings of historical eras. Hobsbawm’s book runs from the 1780s, when the French king first came under attack and the British economy began to industrialize, through to the year of <a data-id=\"2969\" data-type=\"Term\">revolutions in 1848,</a> where popular uprisings against existing governments broke out in many European countries. At this point it seemed as if the newly created order—with liberal politics and a capitalist economy as its bedrock—was once again in crisis. Few could have guessed then that “what followed was not the breakdown of capitalism, but its most rapid and unchallenged period of expansion and triumph.”<a data-id=\"1634\" data-type=\"note\">9</a>The book is also important as a summary of Marxist views of how Western society developed in the modern era. Hobsbawm’s work was admired not just in universities, but also by many left-wing thinkers and moderate politicians. <a data-id=\"11156\" data-type=\"Person\">Ed Miliband,</a> the leader of the British <a data-id=\"2984\" data-type=\"Term\">Labour Party,</a> argued after the historian’s death in 2012 that Hobsbawm “brought hundreds of years of British history to hundreds of thousands of people. He brought history out of the ivory tower and into people’s lives.”<a data-id=\"1635\" data-type=\"note\">10</a> <a data-id=\"11118\" data-type=\"Person\">Tony Blair,</a> the former Labour leader and British Prime Minister, praised Hobsbawm as a “giant of progressive politics history, someone who influenced a whole generation of political and academic leaders. He wrote history that was intellectually of the highest order but combined with a profound sense of compassion and justice. And he was a tireless agitator for a better world.”<a data-id=\"1636\" data-type=\"note\">11</a> It could be argued that Hobsbawm’s histories have above all provided an understanding of world history for the British political left. His books won him many admirers, even among those uncomfortable with his dogged defense of the communist <a data-id=\"3003\" data-type=\"Term\">Soviet Union.</a>",

He had read <i><a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref12\" data-id=\"2963\" data-type=\"Term\">The Communist Manifesto,</a> </i>the work of German theorists <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref13\" data-id=\"11153\" data-type=\"Person\">Karl Marx</a> and <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref14\" data-id=\"11131\" data-type=\"Person\">Friedrich Engels,</a> as a schoolboy in Germany. This experience marked not only his political views, but also his very identity. The moment <i>The Communist Manifesto</i> was published in 1848 acts as something of a climax for the story Hobsbawm outlined in <i>The Age of Revolution</i>.

Even if earlier popular uprisings had ended in failure—as in <a data-score=\"5\" id=\"m-ref21\" data-id=\"2947\" data-type=\"Term\">1848</a>—the memory of revolution remained alive. “But if we look round the world of the 1970s,” said Hobsbawm, “we shall not be tempted to underestimate the historic force of the <a data-score=\"5\" id=\"m-ref22\" data-id=\"3002\" data-type=\"Term\">socialist</a> and communist ideology born out of reaction against the dual revolution, and which by 1848 had found its first classic formulation.”<a href=\"#m-en-19\">8</a> This classic formulation—or blueprint—was provided by Marx and <a data-score=\"6\" id=\"m-ref23\" data-id=\"11131\" data-type=\"Person\">Engels’s</a> <i>Communist Manifesto</i>.Hobsbawm was a lifelong member of the Communist Party of Great Britain, and refused to leave the party—unlike several comrades such as the social historian <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref24\" data-id=\"11175\" data-type=\"Person\">E.

Like many other scholars, he was interested in the <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref33\" data-id=\"2982\" data-type=\"Term\">Industrial Revolution</a> in Britain. Yet there was plenty of disagreement over how quickly or dramatically the Revolution came about.

H. <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref39\" data-id=\"11123\" data-type=\"Person\">Clapham</a> helped create economic history as an academic field in its own right at the start of the twentieth century. Clapham argued that there had been a slow, uneven and delayed transition to an industrial economy. As a result, he asked whether this really deserved to be called a “revolution” at all.<a href=\"#m-en-23\">2</a> After Clapham other scholars, including Hobsbawm, countered that there had been a dramatic “take off” in growth in the late eighteenth century as a wave of new technologies swept across the country.<a href=\"#m-en-24\">3</a>A heated debate was also underway before Hobsbawm over what impact industrialization had had on the working population of Britain. Hobsbawm sided with those who argued that industrialization was a disaster for the standard of living of the British working classes, many of whom were forced to move to the city to find work and found themselves living in squalor. It was the resulting misery that led to the rise of the working-class protest movement in the 1830s and 1840s known as <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref40\" data-id=\"2959\" data-type=\"Term\">Chartism,</a> with its demands for votes for all men and other democratic rights.Political historians were also divided over the question of how much things had changed during this period. Many viewed this era as one of great instability, from the demands for the end of the French monarchy during the Revolution of 1789 to the wave of uprisings against governments right across Europe in <a data-score=\"5\" id=\"m-ref41\" data-id=\"2947\" data-type=\"Term\">1848.</a> American historian R.

Political historians knew this was a period of great turmoil, especially during the explosive years of the French Revolution that began in 1789. But they did not agree on whether the turmoil could have been avoided and who was pushing the changes. Social historians focused on how the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century was the moment when mass political movements began. But how much did that, and particularly the <a data-score=\"5\" id=\"m-ref61\" data-id=\"3002\" data-type=\"Term\">socialist</a> movement, grow out of the French Revolution or the misery of industrial workers?

For them, many of the economic and political systems of the period remained, even if there were some big changes. For these historians, the radical actions of the French Revolution and the growth of socialist ideas were much less important in pushing change in Britain. These changes happened because of moderate reforms carried out by the elites who ran the country. Their careful actions were enough not just for them to hold on to power, but to make this era, according to English historian <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref63\" data-id=\"11120\" data-type=\"Person\">Asa Briggs,</a> an “age of improvement.”<a href=\"#m-en-32\">2</a> The <a data-score=\"5\" id=\"m-ref64\" data-id=\"2964\" data-type=\"Term\">conservative</a> historians did not accept the idea of sharp divisions within British society. Instead, they highlighted areas of agreement between the different social classes.Marxist historians, by contrast, wanted to move away from a focus on the elites and instead looked to write <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref65\" data-id=\"2978\" data-type=\"Term\">history from below</a>—looking at the thoughts and actions of ordinary people. In many ways Hobsbawm was working in a similar way to <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref66\" data-id=\"11175\" data-type=\"Person\">E. P. Thompson,</a> <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref67\" data-id=\"11167\" data-type=\"Person\">Raphael Samuel</a> and <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref68\" data-id=\"11165\" data-type=\"Person\">George Rudé.</a> He spoke for all of them when he said that in the wake of the French Revolution, “What was new in the labour movement of the early nineteenth century was class consciousness and class ambition.”<a href=\"#m-en-33\">3</a> For British Marxists, the protests of those who lost out in the new industrial economy—including <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref69\" data-id=\"2988\" data-type=\"Term\">Luddites</a> (workers who destroyed the new machines that were taking away their traditional jobs), artisans and landless peasants—were a key part of the tradition that would feed into early <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref70\" data-id=\"3002\" data-type=\"Term\">socialism.</a>In French history the Marxist approach was the most widely followed. Here, the fall of the French king was seen as the result of intense struggles between <a data-score=\"4\" id=\"m-ref71\" data-id=\"2966\" data-type=\"Term\">the nobility</a> (the rulers), the bourgeoisie (the emerging group of self-made men) and the lower classes. Yet even here there were signs of differing views. In 1955 British historian <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref73\" data-id=\"11124\" data-type=\"Person\">Alfred Cobban</a> had already attacked the “myth” that the French bourgeoisie rebelled because they hated society under the king’s rule.

He brought together existing research rather than exploring any new archives. But what was original about Hobsbawm’s approach was bringing materials on the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution together and thinking about the relationship between the two events.Hobsbawm strongly believed that the late eighteenth century saw a series of unique and permanent changes. Other historians focused on examples of agreement and compromise, but he argued that the new industrial economy brought about new forms of inequality and exploitation. “The poor suffered because the rich benefitted,”<a href=\"#m-en-35\">5</a> he wrote. In discussing the French Revolution, Hobsbawm followed French Marxist historian <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref78\" data-id=\"11151\" data-type=\"Person\">Georges Lefebvre</a> in arguing that the course of the revolution and the start of <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref79\" data-id=\"3005\" data-type=\"Term\">the Terror</a> in 1792—where terrible atrocities were carried out to “ensure” the success of the French Revolution—were explained by the clash between different social classes.

According to Marx, in the end the proletariat would destroy the bourgeois moneymakers who employed them because of the terrible treatment they received at their hands.

In <i>Primitive Rebels</i>, though, Hobsbawm compared <a data-score=\"5\" id=\"m-ref159\" data-id=\"2964\" data-type=\"Term\">conservative</a> pre-modern social movements—the peasants in developing countries—with the early workers’ movements. The topic was very timely. Hobsbawm was writing when mainly rural French and Portuguese colonies in Asia and Africa were fighting wars of independence. The theme of rural resistance comes up in <i>The Age of Revolution: Europe 1789–1848 </i>too, through studies of the role of the peasantry in France in 1789 or the misery caused by the <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref160\" data-id=\"2971\" data-type=\"Term\">enclosure</a> of land in Britain at the same time. This was the dividing up of common land owned by the whole community to help develop more modern and commercial ways of farming the land.<i>The Age of Revolution</i> marked a transition for Hobsbawm to writing wide-ranging works that took in events in Europe and the wider world. Although he would not often write about the late eighteenth century again, the era of the “<a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref161\" data-id=\"2969\" data-type=\"Term\">dual revolution”</a> was still central to his thinking. For the 200-year anniversary of the 1789 French Revolution he wrote <i>Echoes of the Marseillaise</i>, a book that looked at how scholars’ approaches toward the event had developed. Clearly troubled by rival historians who sought to play down its impact, Hobsbawm insisted the French Revolution had been a class struggle that had changed the world “for the better.”<a href=\"#m-en-75\">3</a>",

The four books together spanned 200 years, from the French Revolution in 1789 to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Hobsbawm’s real subject throughout the four books was the clash between expanding capitalism and its opponents, especially the rise and fall of socialism. It was a process that fascinated him both as a scholar and as a member of the Communist Party.All these books reached a broad public, but Hobsbawm wrote on a huge number of other topics too.

As Rudé noted, this was to be expected in a book that tried to cover so much ground: “This is, of course, history on the heroic scale and any historian that operates over so wide a canvas is liable to expose himself to criticism of the narrower specialist concerned with less ambitious projects.”<a href=\"#m-en-84\">5</a> French historian Jaques <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref174\" data-id=\"11136\" data-type=\"Person\">Godechot</a> made the most blunt criticism of <i>The Age of Revolution</i>. First, he argued the book was too narrow in a geographical sense, treating Britain and France as exceptional cases and overlooking the importance of revolts elsewhere, especially Italy. Secondly, he insisted that Hobsbawm’s historical analysis was weak, since the “<a data-score=\"7\" id=\"m-ref175\" data-id=\"2969\" data-type=\"Term\">dual revolutions”</a> were not really similar.

The French Revolution was unique because it occurred in the greatest monarchy in Europe and because its ambitions and effects were universal—they spread across Europe and the world. Unlike the <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref177\" data-id=\"2951\" data-type=\"Term\">American Revolution,</a> it did not look simply to change what form of government the country should have, but was focused on a complete remaking of society.

But in the decade after his book came out, the truth or usefulness of the Marxist approach was questioned. Marxists had seen a sudden economic “take off” in the Industrial Revolution, accompanied by a dramatic shift from “<a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref181\" data-id=\"2974\" data-type=\"Term\">feudalism”</a> to “<a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref182\" data-id=\"2958\" data-type=\"Term\">capitalism.”</a> But more and more historians began seeing a slow and uneven road leading to the new industrial economy. The economic historian <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref183\" data-id=\"11127\" data-type=\"Person\">Nicholas Crafts</a> argued that the growth of the new metal and textile industries stood alongside traditional types of manufacturing.<a href=\"#m-en-88\">9</a> This raised doubts about the link Hobsbawm claimed between overwhelming industrialization and the beginnings of working-class political awareness.In the field of the French Revolution, revisionist historians like <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref184\" data-id=\"11124\" data-type=\"Person\">Alfred Cobban,</a> <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref185\" data-id=\"11173\" data-type=\"Person\">George V.

As a result it seemed that the Revolution might have been sparked by short-term political conflicts, rather than deeply held feelings by the bourgeoisie and the workers that they were being treated unfairly. Nor, as Hobsbawm claimed, did it seem there was evidence that 1789 had helped the growth of capitalism in France.<a href=\"#m-en-90\">11</a> Yet Hobsbawm, described in many obituaries as stubborn, did not update the argument in light of these challenges.",

They took his claims about the growth of industrial <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref188\" data-id=\"2958\" data-type=\"Term\">capitalism</a> to help explain the economic reasons behind the limiting of women’s freedoms in the early Victorian period<a href=\"#m-en-91\">1</a> from 1837.

    "content": "Like many Marxist historians of his generation, Hobsbawm’s chief focus was on the relations between the social classes (e.g. factory owners, workers, peasants). He tended to neglect how the deep changes he wrote about affected women and racial minorities differently than white men. Yet later female historians like <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref148\" data-id=\"11140\" data-type=\"Person\">Catherine Hall</a> and <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref149\" data-id=\"11128\" data-type=\"Person\">Leonore Davidoff</a> went on to claim that the years around 1800 were key to the rise of a belief in “separate spheres”<a href=\"#m-en-65\">4</a> for men and women. This was the notion that, based on both biological differences and the will of God, men should dominate the public sphere of politics, economy, commerce and law, and women, meanwhile, should inhabit the private sphere of domestic life, child-rearing, housekeeping and religious education. As industrialization started, married men left home to sell their labor for wages, whereas before they had worked around the home <i>alongside</i> their wives. Women now stayed home alone. Industrialization, therefore, helped encourage the ideology of “separate spheres.” Yet as late as 1971, when Hobsbawm wrote about social history, he was silent about the particular effects of industrialization on women. It was a silence that he looked back on in 1997 with “embarrassed astonishment.”<a href=\"#m-en-66\">5</a>Another silence concerns Hobsbawm’s focus on Britain and France as the motors of historical change. Hobsbawm focused on how the innovations made in northwest Europe gradually spread to the rest of the world: “Before [i.e. Faced with] the merchants, the steam-engines, the ships and the guns of the west—and before its ideas—the age-old civilizations and empires of the world capitulated and collapsed.”<a href=\"#m-en-67\">6</a> Yet more recent scholarship has pointed to a more subtle relationship between Europe and the wider world.<a href=\"#m-en-68\">7</a> For example, Hobsbawm mentioned the importance of markets across the empire where Britain could sell goods. This fueled the growth of cotton yarn and fabric production in Britain itself. But other scholars have stressed how the strong growth of industry in Britain actually depended on the de-industrialization—or closing of workshops—in other parts of the empire, especially India.<a href=\"#m-en-69\">8</a> Recent research has shown that when slaves in the French colonies of Saint-Domingue and Guadeloupe rebelled in the 1790s, they did not simply follow the example of the French Republic. In fact, they went far beyond its ideas of liberty to assert new ideas of racial equality.<a href=\"#m-en-70\">9</a> For Hobsbawm, the actions of the industrial workers were the clearest example of resistance to capitalist exploitation. But scholars looking at resistance in the colonies<a href=\"#m-en-71\">10</a> have questioned whether this model can somehow be applied to the rural setting of a former colony like India.<a href=\"#m-en-72\">11</a>",

Just because groups of workers had made demands for better conditions in the 1840s, did that mean a new social group had risen out of the <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref201\" data-id=\"2982\" data-type=\"Term\">Industrial Revolution?</a> The historian <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref202\" data-id=\"11172\" data-type=\"Person\">Gareth Stedman Jones</a> said that what happened in the early nineteenth century was not so much that new classes—the bourgeoisie and the <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref203\" data-id=\"2997\" data-type=\"Term\">proletariat</a>—came into being, but that new ways of talking about social difference appeared.<a href=\"#m-en-98\">8</a> These “languages of class” did not only appear because of the changes in the economy, but also because of changes that were happening in the political debate. For example, there were new demands being made, like extending voting rights to wider groups of people. Stedman Jones has argued that this confusion about what social class actually means can be found throughout Marx’s famous <i><a data-score=\"8\" id=\"m-ref204\" data-id=\"2963\" data-type=\"Term\">Communist Manifesto.</a></i><a href=\"#m-en-99\">9</a>From the 1980s onwards a debate started among historians about how to think about the divisions that existed in nineteenth-century society. Was it right to think of a split into two groups (the elite and the masses) or was it more about three groups: upper, middle and lower? Then again, was that society built more on a range of small differences? Perhaps one result of Hobsbawm’s more flexible use of Marxist categories was to promote a shift away from seeing people’s views as determined by their social class. Instead, scholars paid more attention to the role of culture and political movements in shaping what people thought.",

Modern historian <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref206\" data-id=\"11166\" data-type=\"Person\">Jan Rüger</a> wrote: “Eric Hobsbawm’s nineteenth century remains therefore not only exemplary in the broad sweep, the elegance and style, the sheer amount of knowledge it displays; it also continues to offer a rich encouragement to think Britain and Europe in one context.”<a href=\"#m-en-100\">10</a> Today many scholars accept the importance of producing histories of the revolutionary era in Britain and France that, if not comparative, at least explore connections between, the two countries. For example, intellectual historians look at how thinkers from different backgrounds exchanged ideas on economics or republicanism. Social historians look at how artisans became involved in political fights. Political historians look at military mobilization in an age of war. And cultural historians look at wider communications between England and France.<a href=\"#m-en-101\">11</a>&nbsp;Most scholars today, however, do not share Hobsbawm’s Marxist belief in the rise to power of the bourgeoisie. History professor <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref207\" data-id=\"11154\" data-type=\"Person\">Sarah Maza</a> has further adapted the argument of Gareth Stedman Jones to go so far as to claim that the bourgeoisie never really existed as a group. She believes the term was used as a negative label to describe certain types of self-advancing behavior.<a href=\"#m-en-102\">12</a> This shift in the 1980s away from looking at class relations to looking at culture as a way to understand history worried Hobsbawm. He was convinced that <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref208\" data-id=\"11153\" data-type=\"Person\">Karl Marx</a> had truly asked the most fundamental questions about social change and still agreed with his belief that conflicts between social classes moved history forwards.<a href=\"#m-en-103\">13</a>",

Commenting on Hobsbawm’s work, modern history lecturer <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref211\" data-id=\"11163\" data-type=\"Person\">David Priestland</a> said, “At a time when academic historians were becoming increasingly suspicious of ‘grand narratives’, he saw how important it was to understand the broader forces of historical change.”<a href=\"#m-en-104\">1</a>In recent years other textbooks covering this whole period have been published, such as Tim <a data-score=\"5\" id=\"m-ref212\" data-id=\"11119\" data-type=\"Person\">Blanning’s</a> <i>The Pursuit of Glory</i>, <a data-score=\"7\" id=\"m-ref213\" data-id=\"11135\" data-type=\"Person\">Robert Gildea’s</a> <i>Barricades and Borders</i> or <a data-score=\"7\" id=\"m-ref214\" data-id=\"11170\" data-type=\"Person\">Jonathan Sperber’s</a> <i>Revolutionary Europe 1780–1880</i>.<a href=\"#m-en-105\">2</a> These works are not Marxist, and class struggle is only one part of their stories. However, as their titles suggest, these works tend to go along with Hobsbawm’s view that a deep transformation did occur as the eighteenth century moved into the nineteenth. They disagree with Hobsbawm, though, in their chronologies (when exactly did the continent’s “<a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref215\" data-id=\"2992\" data-type=\"Term\">old regime”</a> disappear? 1799? 1815? 1848?); in their geography (what about the situation in Central, Eastern and Southern Europe?) and above all in their approach to the <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref216\" data-id=\"2955\" data-type=\"Term\">bourgeoisie.</a> Hobsbawm saw the bourgeoisie as the “new, rational men of ability rather than birth”<a href=\"#m-en-106\">3</a> who swept away the old order. In a very provocative book American historian <a data-score=\"8\" id=\"m-ref217\" data-id=\"11155\" data-type=\"Person\">Arno Mayer</a> argues that the old European nobles were not removed at all, but held on to power all the way through to the outbreak of <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref218\" data-id=\"3009\" data-type=\"Term\">World War I</a>, showing “the persistence of the old regime.”<a href=\"#m-en-107\">4</a>",

But new research has made the picture more complex.<a href=\"#m-en-108\">5</a> For example a boom in consumption during the eighteenth century appears to have been a key factor driving the growth in manufacturing.<a href=\"#m-en-109\">6</a> In economic terms, this suggests the importance not only of the supply of new goods—but also of the demand for them—in the expansion of the new industrial economy. Other historians have focused on Britain’s success in spreading new skills and technology in making her Europe’s “first knowledge economy.”<a href=\"#m-en-110\">7</a> Such scholars would adjust Hobsbawm’s dates by placing the first sparks of the Industrial Revolution a hundred years earlier during the <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref220\" data-id=\"2972\" data-type=\"Term\">Enlightenment</a> of the late seventeenth century.

Historian <a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref222\" data-id=\"11162\" data-type=\"Person\">Richard N.

For example, Bayly agrees that the “desire of capitalists to maximize their income and to subordinate labor was an inexorable [unstoppable] force for change, not just in the west, but across Asia and Africa.”<a href=\"#m-en-116\">13</a> But he says this mentality did not really take hold until the 1840s and 1850s.

In the first half of the book Hobsbawm outlines the origins of the “<a data-score=\"10\" id=\"m-ref134\" data-id=\"2969\" data-type=\"Term\">dual revolution.”</a> In the second half he goes on to explore how its effects spread through Europe.

    "content": "Michel Foucault was born in Poitiers, France in 1926. After graduating from his <em>lycée*</em> (high-school), he entered the competitive classes for admission to one of France’s most prestigious higher education institutions, the École Normale Supérieure (ENS).* There he studied under and alongside some of the most important thinkers of his time. He initially gained a degree in psychology, while also receiving training in history and philosophy. He later went on to teach psychology at the ENS, before going on to other institutions including the University of California, Berkeley.&nbsp;In the early part of his career, much of Foucault’s work examined the history of medicine. From the mid-1950s he was known for his critical work on the history of madness, its diagnosis, and its treatment. His central interest throughout his career was the relationship between power and knowledge in society, and how it affects the lives of individuals. “What is an Author?” was written and presented as a lecture in France in 1969. By this point in his career, Foucault had turned to more general analyses of knowledge and power in society through the idea of discourse,* which he examined in his work from the mid-1960s onwards. Later, his work extended to examine the history of prisons and punishment, and the history of sexuality.&nbsp;From the late 1970s onwards, Foucault was perhaps the most famous philosopher and public intellectual in the world. Through translations and his lectures at Berkeley, his work became well known in the United States where it helped revolutionize the fields of humanities and social sciences. Credited as a formative influence on the schools of New Historicism* and Queer Theory,* Foucault is recognized as one of “the most influential thinkers of the latter [sic] twentieth century.”<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\">[i]</a>&nbsp;\n<hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\">\n<div id=\"edn1\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> C.

    "content": "“What is an Author?” is one of Foucault’s few works directly applicable to literary theory. Its central argument is that critics and historians should not focus their attention on finding out what an author wanted to communicate in a text. Instead, they should focus on how the social and legal conditions of specific societies influence and control the relationship between texts and their writers. For Foucault, texts, authors, and the idea of the author are closely related to the way power circulates in societies—or more simply, how societies exert control over human beings.This emphasis stems from the initial argument that we cannot know exactly what an author intended—even if the author themselves knew what they intended—and that this cannot, therefore, be the “true meaning” of a text. Other critics had taken this stance before Foucault. Notably his friend Roland Barthes* had argued that meaning was created by readers, <em>not</em> authors, and thus famously pronounced “the death of the author.”* This was a controversial stance that stirred up considerable debate at the time.Foucault’s essay works from a similar starting point as Barthes’s idea, but reaches a different conclusion. For Foucault, what is interesting is that, despite the reader’s role in creating meaning, we give texts “authors” anyway. Indeed, as he puts it, some kinds of texts demand authors, or come equipped with what he terms an “author function.”* &nbsp;That is, they come with assigned authors whom we regard as “responsible” for the work, and whom we tend to construct as living, breathing human beings. Crucially, however, they are precisely not real human beings, but, rather, a function of certain social processes.“What is an Author?” focuses on these social processes and on the “author function.” The essay asks, in an open-ended way, when society first felt the need to assign texts to authors, and why. It then goes on to ask what kinds of texts are equipped with an “author function,” and what that function does for them. Finally, Foucault asks whether there are other kinds of discourse that can be said to have authors or author functions.Foucault’s central suggestion regarding these questions is that texts and their meanings become tied to authors in order for states to be able to exert power over them. That is, texts are legally attributed to authors in order for states to be able to hold authors responsible for their words. By this mechanism, states can make sure that writers do not contradict or unsettle social structures. The author is, therefore, a function used to control texts as they circulate, and is, as a result, linked to how power permeates society.&nbsp;This is a crucial theme throughout Foucault’s work: the way in which seemingly natural social processes and apparently “natural” or “instinctive” assumptions are in fact “socially constructed,”—generated and, as it were, bred into us by society.",

    "content": "Michel Foucault’s “What is an Author?” is a classic text in literary theory and practice. Originally presented as a lecture to the Société française de philosophie* on February 22, 1969, it is still taught and read as a contribution to conceptual investigations of the author. Often read alongside William K. Wimsatt* and Monroe C. Beardsley’s* “The Intentional Fallacy”* (1946) and Roland Barthes’s “The Death of the Author” (1968), it is a standard text in introductory courses on literary theory.&nbsp;Beyond the issues surrounding authors in literary criticism, “What is an Author?” is a superb gateway for readers who want to expand their horizons in literary theory more generally. It can be traced as in important text for later trends, particularly New Historicism. On account of its length and relatively self-contained arguments, it also serves as an approachable introduction to the rest of Foucault’s work.As one of the most significant thinkers of the second half of the twentieth century, Foucault’s influence extends across intellectual history, literary criticism, philosophy, and sociology. Sooner or later, most students in the humanities and social sciences find themselves needing to have some familiarity with his thought. “What is an Author?” is an excellent starting point.",

    "content": "Michel Foucault’s “What is an Author?” is a work of literary and historical theory. It is the product of a time in French thought that has come to be seen as a watershed in intellectual history. The 1960s is the decade when “theory,” or “French theory” as it is often called, was born.This label is retrospective but nevertheless useful for describing both Foucault’s own work (otherwise commonly deemed unclassifiable) and the context it came from.<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> Interdisciplinary, and therefore difficult to describe without oversimplification, “theory” was born from thinkers working across literature, philosophy, and history to critically analyze the accepted truths of their disciplines. Incorporating insights from political theory, psychology, and linguistics, many of the French theorists (including Foucault) worked through skeptical “archaeologies” or “genealogies” of ideas long taken for granted by society at large.Though frequently in vigorous debate with each other, these theorists participated in what was in some sense a common project. By showing that such ideas had shifted and changed throughout history, the French theorists often made it impossible to take them for granted or see them as natural any longer. Foucault’s immediate environment included major figures such as Jacques Derrida,* Gilles Deleuze,* and Julia Kristeva.* With regard to “What is an Author?” specifically, however, the work of Louis Althusser* and Roland Barthes is particularly relevant.&nbsp;\n<hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\">\n<div id=\"edn1\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> See, e.g., Vincent B.

    "content": "The two most important theoretical contexts for “What is an Author?” are Marxism* and structuralism.* These two schools of thought, often in dialogue, deeply informed Foucault’s approach to texts in the essay.Marxism was important both to the general French intellectual tradition in Foucault’s time and to his education in particular. Based on the thought of nineteenth century German philosopher and economist Karl Marx, Marxism comes in many varieties. Along with providing the theoretical basis for Communism,* Marxism provided scholars with powerful tools for conceptualizing the relationship between texts, their creators, and their historical contexts.<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> Importantly for Foucault’s work, a crucial tenet of Marxism is that human nature has changed across the course of history, and that individuals’ “subjectivity”—a technical term for “personhood”—is created by the economic conditions of their society. Expanded and diversified by thinkers familiar to Foucault—especially Louis Althusser—Marxist* thought was heavily influential for scholars seeking to relate texts to their historical contexts.The second school of thought to inform literary theory in Foucault’s academic context was structuralism. A similarly varied movement, famous for its complexity, structuralism originated with Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure,* before being exported to other academic contexts by French anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss.* At its most basic, structuralism argues that the meanings of cultural phenomena stem from their relationships to each other and to larger systems or structures. For example, in order to understand a text readers work via an often unconscious knowledge of the structures within which it works, such as genre or narrative form. Without knowledge of those structures, the meaning of the text cannot be discerned.<a href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\" title=\"\">[ii]</a>Alongside Marxism, structuralism was the dominant intellectual movement in 1950s and 1960s France. Foucault’s 1966 book <em>Les mots et les choses </em>(translated as <em>The Order of Things</em>) is “Recognizably a structuralist history” for its attention to the structures that generate “knowledge” in history.<a href=\"#_edn3\" name=\"_ednref3\" title=\"\">4</a> This thread continues with “What is an Author?” and one structuralist figure above all is crucial for understanding the essay: Foucault’s friend Roland Barthes.&nbsp;\n<hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\">\n<div id=\"edn1\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> For an introductory discussion of Marx’s contribution to literary and cultural theory, see <a name=\"_Hlk500315643\">Gavin Grindon and Michael Ryan, “Marxism” in <em>The Encyclopedia of Literary and Cultural Theory</em>, eds.

    "content": "Michel Foucault’s 1969 “What is an Author?” addresses the complex issue of the relationship between authorial intention and the meaning of texts. As French literary theorist Antoine Compagnon* notes, the place of the author is one of the most “stormy” debates in literary theory.<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> The debate comes back to a fundamental question: what defines or generates a text’s meaning?Compagnon outlines three camps of critics who address this. The first camp belongs to the oldest tradition of “common sense” literary criticism. Here, it was generally accepted that the meaning of a text is the meaning <em>the author intended to put into it</em>. Understanding a text, in this tradition, means finding out what the author wants to communicate. Thus, the critic’s job is either to find out directly what an author intended to say (e.g. from their letters or diaries) or to do so by processes of deduction.<a href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\" title=\"\">[ii]</a>This approach came under attack by several groups of theorists during the twentieth century. Together they comprise Compagnon’s second camp. These included the Russian Formalists* (prominent around the 1910s to the1930s), the Anglo-American New Critics* (prominent in the 1940s and 1950s), and the French Structuralists* (prominent in the 1950s and 1960s). In different ways, these theorists advocated looking for a text’s significance regardless of authorial intention.Compagnon’s third camp, just emerging around the time of Foucault’s essay, put emphasis instead on reader reception. They suggested, to varying extents, that meaning was generated primarily by reader interactions with texts.To Compagnon’s trio we can add a fourth camp also emerging around this time: critics, often influenced by Marxist theory, seeking to root texts in historical, social, and intellectual contexts. To varying degrees, these historicist* critics also demoted authorial intention as a priority. They analyzed texts as products of particular social and economic conditions rather than as products of individual authors.&nbsp;\n<hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\">\n<div id=\"edn1\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> Antoine Compagnon, <em>Le Démon de la théorie: Littérature et sens commun</em> (Paris: Seuil, 1998), 51 (my translation).</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"edn2\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref2\" name=\"_edn2\" title=\"\">[ii]</a> Compagnon, <em>Démon</em>, 51.</p>\n</div>\n",

    "content": "Debates around authorial intention were not limited to France. In 1946, the American New Critics William K. Wimsatt Jr. and Monroe C. Beardsley published their famous paper “The Intentional Fallacy.” This targeted the common assumption that authorial intention defined the true meaning of texts. The New Critics insisted instead that meaning inheres in texts as aesthetic objects. A poem, for instance, may generate effects and meanings beyond or even contradictory to its author’s intention, and, accordingly, it should be judged and understood by these. Above all, Wimsatt and Beardsley argued that&nbsp;part of the problem is that we cannot <em>know</em> an author’s intention. Therefore, the “intention of the author is neither available nor desirable as a standard for judging the success of a work of literary art.”<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\">[i]</a>The French debate, though separate, occurred along similar lines: traditionalist advocates of author-centered criticism versus the predominantly structuralist proponents of <em>nouvelle critique</em>.*<a href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\" title=\"\">[ii]</a> Foremost among the structuralists was Roland Barthes, who, across a series of books and articles from 1963 to 1968, entered into a savage debate with the traditionalist Raymond Picard.* The debate culminated in Barthes’s famous 1968 essay “The Death of the Author,” which directly stimulated Foucault’s essay.\n<hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\">\n<div id=\"edn1\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> See William K.

    "content": "Michel Foucault’s “What is an Author?” turns the debates around authorial intention and the “death of the author” on their heads to attack them from a different angle. But as Foucault explained to the essay’s original audience in 1969, he is himself “far from offering a solution” to the problems surrounding the author.<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> Instead, it is his intention to raise and highlight the questions posed by the figure of the author.Foucault outlined four areas in which he wanted to interrogate the idea of the author:<a href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\" title=\"\">[ii]</a>\n\t<li>To ask what we mean by “the name of the author,” since authors’ names work in some way differently to people’s names in the general sense.</li>\n\t<li>To consider how “appropriation” works regarding authors and texts, since “the author is neither exactly the owner nor the person in charge of his texts; and nor is he the producer or the inventor of them.”</li>\n\t<li>To consider how attribution works by asking what it means to attribute or de-attribute a text to an author, and questioning how we do this.</li>\n\t<li>To consider “the position of the author” regarding a text. In everyday speech, the meaning of words like “I,” “you,” or “today” is clear, but in authored texts their meaning is unclear. “I,” for instance, very rarely means “I the author;” so what does it mean exactly? How does the author’s position in and/or outside of the text change, depending on the type of text involved?&nbsp;</li>\nThese are four complex areas, and though Foucault regarded Roland Barthes’s “death of the author” thesis as a dead end, he makes clear that he sees his own essay as an unfinished, open-ended response to it. His central aim was to shift the debate from the sterile opposition between Barthes and more traditional literary critics like Raymond Picard. This is an aim that “What is an Author?” fulfills entirely.&nbsp;\n<hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\">\n<div id=\"edn1\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> Michel Foucault, <em>Dits et Écrits</em>, eds.

    "content": "Two central constants in Foucault’s entire body of work are key to understanding “What is an Author?” The first is the examination of theoretical or philosophical questions through historical specifics. The second is the examination of how individuals, language, and discourse are shaped by power relations in society.In contrast to Roland Barthes’s desire to theorize around authorship away from its many historical incarnations, “What is an Author?” attempts to theorize on the basis of historical evidence. As Foucault points out, authorship “does not affect all discourses in the same way at all times and in all types of civilization.”<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> He is interested in the different forms the author has taken throughout history, and how this has affected the relationship of authors to the meaning of their texts.This is directly linked to Foucault’s interest in power through the essay’s discussion of the legal status of authors. As Foucault notes, the idea of the author “is linked to the juridical and institutional system” of the society in which the author lives.<a href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\" title=\"\">[ii]</a> Laws, he argues, are what tie authors to texts, by giving them both ownership and responsibility for what they say. In other words, authorship becomes important when authorities want to be able to punish people for the texts they produce. For example, if those texts are regarded as transgressive due to reasons of political dissent, or religious or sexual obscenity.The focus on the idea of the author within history as defined by power structures in society marks a decisive original turn in the debates around authorial intention. It marked Foucault out both from traditional literary critics’ reliance on biographical detail, and from Barthes’s radical move of placing authors aside in favor of readers.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n<hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\">\n<div id=\"edn1\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> Michel Foucault, “What is an Author?”, in <em>The Essential Works of Michel Foucault, 1954-1984.

    "content": "Michel Foucault’s 1969 essay “What is an Author?” focuses on opening new avenues of enquiry about authors and the meanings of their texts. Its overarching argument is that we can neither treat the author of a text as a real person (whose intentions we can know, and whose intentions explain the work) nor as an absence or dead figure (who has no impact on or control over the meaning of the work).Foucault argues that neither of these approaches reveals much of real significance about a text or about the society that produced it. As a social activist, philosopher, and historian of ideas, Foucault is interested in precisely the latter, so he suggests a third approach. Taking a question from Samuel Beckett* as his starting point, Foucault asks “What does it matter who is speaking?” in or through a text. Unlike Barthes, he suggests that it does on some level matter “who is speaking,” but it matters primarily in relation to the specific social processes at specific points in history. Instead of examining authors as individuals, therefore, we should look at the idea of the “author function” and how it relates to certain kinds of texts in certain kinds of society.The specifics of the “author function” and how it relates to different kinds of discourse (Foucault’s term for texts, kinds of texts, and particular ways of using language to express knowledge of the world) will be discussed below. For the moment, however, it is worth noting that despite the seemingly fine distinction between “author” and “author function,” the shift leads to a radical conclusion. As Foucault explains, it means that we must “entirely reverse the traditional idea of the author.”<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> Instead of seeing him or her as “the genial creator of a work” to which he or she gives “an inexhaustible variety of significations,” we should see him or her as “a certain functional principle” by which “one limits, excludes, and chooses” significations.<a href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\" title=\"\">[ii]</a> In other words, rather than opening up a world of possible meanings, “the author” is a construct that curtails and limits possible meanings.&nbsp;\n<hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\">\n<div id=\"edn1\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> Michel Foucault, “What is an Author?”, in <em>The Essential Works of Michel Foucault, 1954-1984.

    "content": "It is key to Foucault’s argument that the author cannot be treated as a “real person.” Among other reasons, this is because an author’s name is complex, with different meanings and different ways of being affected by reality. A real person’s name, like “Pierre Dupont,” does not tell us anything about him. But an author’s name does. “Shakespeare”* is “the equivalent of a description” or series of descriptions.<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> &nbsp;The name “Shakespeare” does not just designate a person, it also <em>means</em> several things: the man who wrote <em>Hamlet</em>,* the national poet of England, and so on.<a href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\" title=\"\">[ii]</a>Because of this, authors’ names can be affected by certain kinds of shifts in our knowledge. If “we proved that Shakespeare did not write those sonnets which pass for his,” or that he did produce other famous works now known by other authors’ names, “that would entirely modify the functioning of his name.”<a href=\"#_edn3\" name=\"_ednref3\" title=\"\">[iii]</a> Similarly, if we said “Pierre Dupont does not exist,” that is “not at all the same thing as saying that Homer* […] did not exist.”<a href=\"#_edn4\" name=\"_ednref4\" title=\"\">[iv]</a> In reality, Homer probably did not exist as a lone author who wrote the <em>Odyssey</em>* and the <em>Iliad</em>,* but the name “Homer” still has a status and a set of functions as an author.Crucially, the author’s name is really a <em>function</em>: it “performs a certain role,” or set of roles.<a href=\"#_edn5\" name=\"_ednref5\" title=\"\">[v]</a> &nbsp;It groups texts together, defines and contrasts them to others, and allows us to treat them in certain ways. Most of all, it “serves to characterize a certain mode of being of discourse.” <a href=\"#_edn6\" name=\"_ednref6\" title=\"\">[vi]</a> If “one can say ‘this was written by so-and-so’ or ‘so-and-so is its author,’” we know that “this discourse is not everyday speech that merely comes and goes.” Instead, it “must be received in a certain mode and […], in a given culture, must receive a certain status.”<a href=\"#_edn7\" name=\"_ednref7\" title=\"\">[vii]</a>In our culture, Foucault asserts, the author function has four characteristics:\n\t<li>It is linked to the legal system through both ownership rights (i.e. copyright laws) and the state’s desire to be able to punish the originators of transgressive works.</li>\n\t<li>It does not affect “all discourses in a universal and constant way.”<a href=\"#_edn8\" name=\"_ednref8\" title=\"\">[viii]</a> For example, historically, literary texts have often circulated anonymously, while “scientific” texts were once only respected if they came from a recognized authority (such as Aristotle* or Galen*); now the situation is largely reversed.</li>\n\t<li>The author function “does not develop spontaneously” but appears as the “result of a complex operation that constructs a certain being of reason that we call the ‘author.’”<a href=\"#_edn9\" name=\"_ednref9\" title=\"\">[ix]</a> This depends very much on what we accept as being the author’s work (or not), and on how we define “work.” For example, do letters, shopping lists, etc. by authors count?</li>\n\t<li>Finally, the author function is not “a pure and simple reconstruction made secondhand from a text,” but something more complicated. It is related to a real-life person—the author—but cannot be equated with him or her. Instead “the author function is carried out and operates in the scission […] this division and this distance” between the “author,” “the real writer,” and “the fictitious speaker.”<a href=\"#_edn10\" name=\"_ednref10\" title=\"\">[x]</a> In other words, it is created by and exists in the gap between our idea of the author, the real-life writer, and the voice of the text itself.</li>\nFoucault suggests that we must attend to these four problematics if we are to go beyond the old debates on authorial intention.&nbsp;\n<hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\">\n<div id=\"edn1\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> Foucault, “What is an Author?”, 209.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"edn2\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref2\" name=\"_edn2\" title=\"\">[ii]</a> Foucault, “What is an Author?”, 209.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"edn3\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref3\" name=\"_edn3\" title=\"\">[iii]</a> Foucault, “What is an Author?”, 210.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"edn4\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref4\" name=\"_edn4\" title=\"\">[iv]</a> Foucault, “What is an Author?”, 210.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"edn5\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref5\" name=\"_edn5\" title=\"\">[v]</a> Foucault, “What is an Author?”, 211.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"edn6\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref6\" name=\"_edn6\" title=\"\">[vi]</a> Foucault, “What is an Author?”, 211.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"edn7\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref7\" name=\"_edn7\" title=\"\">[vii]</a> Foucault, “What is an Author?”, 211.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"edn8\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref8\" name=\"_edn8\" title=\"\">[viii]</a> Foucault, “What is an Author?”, 212.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"edn9\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref9\" name=\"_edn9\" title=\"\">[ix]</a> Foucault, “What is an Author?”, 213.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"edn10\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref10\" name=\"_edn10\" title=\"\">[x]</a> Foucault, “What is an Author?”, 215.</p>\n</div>\n",

    "content": "Michel Foucault’s 1969 essay “What is an Author?” holds three secondary ideas of interest to students and critics. All three are part of Foucault’s deliberately open-ended approach to his subject. Having identified the author function as imposing a limit on interpretation, Foucault himself is keen to remove such limits. He does so at the end of the essay by proposing three new directions.The first concerns Foucault’s sense that it was intellectually unjustifiable to limit himself to a purely text-centered idea of authorship. Put simply, he asks what other kinds of objects or discourses can be authored. As he points out, Sigmund Freud* was in some way the “author” of psychoanalysis,* though it is an ongoing discourse in which many other authors have participated. This relates to authorship in a way that Foucault suggests requires further investigation. How, he asks, might “authored discourses” of this kind reflect on the idea of the author function?The second secondary idea is Foucault’s call for the author function to be incorporated into a “historical analysis of discourse.”<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> What can the author function tell us about how discourses have circulated in societies through history? And what can that tell us about our own society?The third secondary idea is what one theorist has called Foucault’s “maddeningly brief” look at the possibility that the author function will disappear from our culture.<a href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\" title=\"\">[ii]</a> What if, Foucault asks, the conditions of discourse change in such a way that authors no longer impede the totally free circulation of texts. What if, to return to the essay’s opening question, it made no difference who was speaking?\n<hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\">\n<div id=\"edn1\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> Michel Foucault, “What is an Author?”, in <em>The Essential Works of Michel Foucault, 1954-1984.

    "content": "As Foucault notes, “one can be the author of much more than a book.”<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> Aside from music or fine art, one can author a theory, tradition, or discipline in which “other books and authors will in their turn find a place.”<a href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\" title=\"\">[ii]</a> How, Foucault asks, do we approach a figure like Sigmund Freud who has, in some sense, authored an entire field?Foucault’s response is, in his own words, “very schematic;” he makes it clear that he is raising the subject predominantly to show the complexity of the author function.<a href=\"#_edn3\" name=\"_ednref3\" title=\"\">[iii]</a> &nbsp;It is, he notes, “complex enough when one tries to situate it at the level of a book or a series of texts,” but it “involves still more determining factors when one tries to analyze it in larger units;” this is a problem he sets aside for another time.<a href=\"#_edn4\" name=\"_ednref4\" title=\"\">[iv]</a>Complexity also lies behind the second secondary idea, which is perhaps the crux of the essay. As the author function is so complex and so deeply related to certain kinds of discourse, Foucault calls for a deeper study of it as a means of performing a “historical analysis of discourse.”<a href=\"#_edn5\" name=\"_ednref5\" title=\"\">[v]</a> As noted above, he is interested in literature not primarily for itself, but as a means of understanding the history of ideas and society. As discourse is, for Foucault, the most significant structuring aspect of society, it is natural for him to question whether the insight of the author function has wider implications.For Foucault, these ideas are inevitably bound up with power, which is inextricably related to how discourses circulate in society. It is significant that the author function has so much to do with legal power, for text-producers over their own texts, and for states over texts and text-producers both. In other words, copyright gives writers legal ownership of their texts, which allows them to control circulation and make money from their work. But, at the same time, it also allows states to hold writers responsible and punish them if their work is deemed transgressive or dangerous. Similarly, the author function serves to limit readers’ interpretations: the “author” becomes a figure for ruling out interpretations he or she cannot have intended, thereby preventing texts from being interpreted too freely. Thus, for Foucault, the author is not the source of meaning but “the ideological figure by which one marks the manner in which we fear the proliferation of meaning.”<a href=\"#_edn6\" name=\"_ednref6\" title=\"\">[vi]</a>This is the source of his final idea in the essay. While it would be “pure romanticism” to imagine a society in which neither authors nor such fears existed, he takes a moment to consider the possibility.<a href=\"#_edn7\" name=\"_ednref7\" title=\"\">[vii]</a> &nbsp;It would be a world in which “All discourses, whatever their status, form, value, and whatever the treatment to which they will be subjected, would develop in the anonymity of a murmur.”<a href=\"#_edn8\" name=\"_ednref8\" title=\"\">[viii]</a> With this, the old questions—“Who really spoke? Is it really he and not someone else? With what authenticity or originality?”—would disappear.<a href=\"#_edn9\" name=\"_ednref9\" title=\"\">10</a> Instead, critics and theorists would ask questions relating to discourse and power, indifferent to the old question of who is speaking.<a href=\"#_edn10\" name=\"_ednref10\" title=\"\">[ix]</a>&nbsp;\n<hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\">\n<div id=\"edn1\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> Foucault, “What is an Author?”, 217.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"edn2\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref2\" name=\"_edn2\" title=\"\">[ii]</a> Foucault, “What is an Author?”, 217.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"edn3\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref3\" name=\"_edn3\" title=\"\">[iii]</a> Foucault, “What is an Author?”, 220.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"edn4\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref4\" name=\"_edn4\" title=\"\">[iv]</a> Foucault, “What is an Author?”, 220.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"edn5\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref5\" name=\"_edn5\" title=\"\">[v]</a> Foucault, “What is an Author?”, 220.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"edn6\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref6\" name=\"_edn6\" title=\"\">[vi]</a> Foucault, “What is an Author?”, 220.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"edn7\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref7\" name=\"_edn7\" title=\"\">[vii]</a> Foucault, “What is an Author?”, 222.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"edn8\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref8\" name=\"_edn8\" title=\"\">[viii]</a> Foucault, “What is an Author?”, 222.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"edn9\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref9\" name=\"_edn9\" title=\"\">10</a> Foucault, “What is an Author?”, 222.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"edn10\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref10\" name=\"_edn10\" title=\"\">[ix]</a> Foucault, “What is an Author?”, 222.</p>\n</div>\n",

    "content": "To give a fair assessment of “What is an Author?” it is useful to remember the essay’s original context, including Michel Foucault’s prefatory remarks and the debate he had with his listeners. These are only available in the transcript of Foucault’s original lecture, published in the <em>Bulletin de la Société française de philosophie</em> in 1969.<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> Here Foucault is clear that he was presenting an unfinished work. As he put it in the post-lecture debate, he had sketched his thoughts “very roughly” (<em>très grossièrement</em>), and in a deliberately “abstract” way as a means of “laying out his stall” (<em>une mise en place d’ensemble</em>). It was, he goes on to suggest, more a “survey of the building site” than an attempt to build.<a href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\" title=\"\">[ii]</a>Given that Foucault’s audience on this occasion included major intellectual figures such as <a name=\"_Hlk500317938\">Jacques Lacan</a>* and <a name=\"_Hlk500317947\">Lucien Goldmann</a>,* it is easy to perceive a mixture of rhetorical modesty and defensiveness in these remarks. But, at the same time, they indicate that “What is an Author?” should be regarded as laying out possibilities and opening up questions rather than staking out a firm position. As Adrian Wilson has noted, Foucault’s primary aims were to respond to Roland Barthes’s “The Death of the Author,” and “to problematize” the figure of the author.<a href=\"#_edn3\" name=\"_ednref3\" title=\"\">[iii]</a> It is, therefore, a text characterized by uncertainties rather than conclusions.On these terms, however, Foucault presents an undeniably strong argument. Though he does not go deeply into historical specifics, Foucault forms a convincing argument for using the author function as a means of conceptualizing the complex way in which writers, readers, and texts interact. He does so by appealing to the different manifestations of authority and anonymity across history, and to how legal frameworks have fixed the concept of authorship in new ways, particularly from the eighteenth century onward.<a href=\"#_edn4\" name=\"_ednref4\" title=\"\">[iv]</a>&nbsp;\n<hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\">\n<div id=\"edn1\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> Michel Foucault, “Qu’est-ce qu’un auteur?”, <em>Bulletin de la Société française de philosophie</em>, 63, no. 3, July-September 1969, pp.73-104.

    "content": "The achievement of “What is an Author?” can be summed up in a single sentence. As Adrian Wilson puts it, it made clear how “the figure of the ‘author’ is an interpretative construct: a construct associated with canonical words, notionally identified as the writer of such works, but none the less categorically distinct from that writer.”<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> In other words, Foucault made it possible to see how the “author” and the real person who wrote a given text are not the same thing. The “author” is meant to be precisely that, but is not. Instead, he or she is a tool built to aid and ground interpretations of the text. A markedly less extreme stance than Roland Barthes’s famous “Death of the Author” polemic, this argument has met widespread acceptance in modern literary criticism, even when skeptically readdressed by critics.The essay’s impact was smaller in France than in the United States, but was notable nevertheless. Soon after its appearance, it exerted an influence on Roland Barthes’s own thought concerning authorship. As Wilson notes, Barthes responded directly to the prominence that Foucault gave “the text” over “the work” in his own 1971 essay “From Work to Text.”<a href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\" title=\"\">[ii]</a>This swift response from Barthes neatly marks out Foucault’s other main achievement with the essay. “What is an Author?” played a significant role in shifting emphasis from writers to the text itself. This is a shift in literary theory that gained momentum during the 1970s and 1980s, and has remained strong ever since.<a href=\"#_edn3\" name=\"_ednref3\" title=\"\">[iii]</a> In the United States, this can be traced directly to the important place of “What is an Author?” in the general uptake of “French theory” in North American universities from the 1970s onward.<a href=\"#_edn4\" name=\"_ednref4\" title=\"\">[iv]</a> It was one of the earliest works to be canonized as “French theory” after Foucault presented it, in a lightly modified version, at the University of Buffalo New York in 1970. First published in English in 1979, as part of a collection of short texts in literary theory, <em>Textual Strategies: Perspectives in Post-Structuralist* Literary Criticism</em>, it has had a central place in literary theory and on student reading lists ever since.<a href=\"#_edn5\" name=\"_ednref5\" title=\"\">[v]</a>&nbsp;\n<hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\">\n<div id=\"edn1\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> Adrian Wilson, “Foucault on the ‘Question of the Author’: A Critical Exegesis”,</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<em>The Modern Language Review</em>, Vol. 99, No. 2 (Apr., 2004), 360.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"edn2\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref2\" name=\"_edn2\" title=\"\">[ii]</a> Wilson, “Foucault on the ‘Question of the Author’”, 343.

    "content": "Despite its importance in literary theory, Michel Foucault’s “What is an Author?” is undeniably a minor work in the overall context of his career—a career notable both for extreme productivity and astonishing variety. Foucault had already published five books by the time he presented “What is an Author?”<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> These included his seminal works <em>History of Madness</em><a href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\" title=\"\">[ii]</a> and <em>Birth of the Clinic</em>,<a href=\"#_edn3\" name=\"_ednref3\" title=\"\">[iii]</a> as well as his equally seminal investigation into the history and sociology of the human sciences,* <em>Les mots et les choses</em> (translated in 1970 as <em>The Order of Things</em>).<a href=\"#_edn4\" name=\"_ednref4\" title=\"\">[iv]</a> When “What is an Author?” was presented in February 1969, Foucault was also extremely close to publishing yet another seminal text, <em>The Archaeology of Knowledge</em>, which appeared that March.<a href=\"#_edn5\" name=\"_ednref5\" title=\"\">[v]</a>Foucault’s output of books slowed slightly after the 1960s, with his major book-length works from the 1970s limited to <em>Surveiller et punir</em> (1975; translated as <em>Discipline and Punish</em>),<a href=\"#_edn6\" name=\"_ednref6\" title=\"\">[vi]</a> and the incomplete, three-volume <em>History of Sexuality</em>.<a href=\"#_edn7\" name=\"_ednref7\" title=\"\">[vii]</a> Overall, though, he was as productive in other ways, with a steady flow of lectures, seminars, and interviews in both Europe and North America. His collected shorter works alone, <em>Dits et écrits, 1954-1988</em>—as yet untranslated into English—amount to four volumes in the original edition.<a href=\"#_edn8\" name=\"_ednref8\" title=\"\">[viii]</a>It is notable that authorship is not a theme Foucault ever returned to explicitly, though he contributed to his “history of discourse” mentioned in “What is an Author?” with <em>The Archaeology of Knowledge</em>.<a href=\"#_edn9\" name=\"_ednref9\" title=\"\">[ix]</a> While he explicitly presented the lecture as an outline for further work, he never saw fit to substantially redraft or alter it for later audiences. When he presented “What is an Author?” again as a lecture in the United States in 1970, he made no substantial changes, and was happy for any of the three published versions available to be reprinted without making any distinction between them.

    "content": "As a whole, Foucault’s work is generally, and quite fairly, considered unclassifiable. Though much of it is historical in nature, it crosses disciplinary borders with ease. It is also marked by its use of material and theory from several disciplines—history, psychology, philosophy, sociology, and literary criticism—to serve its own ends. In terms of topics, his work ranges from psychology to the histories of science, medicine, punishment, and sexuality, among others. The literary is a recurring but only minor theme.<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\">[i]</a>Within such a vast output, it would be astonishing if a piece as short as “What is an Author?” played a major role, but it is nevertheless representative of certain fundamental themes in Foucault’s work as a whole. With its interest in reconstructing a genealogy or archaeology of authorship, it is easy to see how it ties into the themes of both <em>Les mots et les choses</em> and <em>L’Archéologie du savoir</em>. As Simon During points out in <em>Foucault and Literature</em>, “What is an Author?” belongs far more alongside these books than any of Foucault’s directly literary writings.<a href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\" title=\"\">[ii]</a> &nbsp;In looking toward discourse and governmentality,* the essay’s concern with legal constructions and appropriations of the individual foreshadows <em>Surveiller et punir</em> and <em>The History of Sexuality</em>.Through this, it is clear that “What is an Author?” is marked by something that Foucault considered representative of his work as a whole: a desire to “put ‘in play,’ show up, transform and reverse the systems which quietly order us about” in the things we take for granted.

    "content": "A curious element in the immediate reception of Michel Foucault’s “What is an Author?” was the extent to which it was misunderstood. At its first presentation in France in 1969, the eminent French intellectuals who debated with Foucault directly afterward were, to say the least, skeptical of the paper. This was in no small part due to a conviction that the essay repeated Roland Barthes’s thesis of the “death of the author.”<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\">[i]</a>This was immediately apparent when the floor opened to questions. The novelist <a name=\"_Hlk500319834\">Jean d’Ormesson</a>* said that Foucault’s central thesis was “the death of man,”* and that this time he had simply “attacked the weakest link in the chain”: the author.<a href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\" title=\"\">[ii]</a> That is, d’Ormesson felt it was already clear that the “author” cannot be treated as a real person, and regarded Foucault as attacking the idea of fixed human nature. But, d’Ormesson went on to say, “I said to myself that, all the same, there are authors.”<a href=\"#_edn3\" name=\"_ednref3\" title=\"\">[iii]</a> D’Ormesson was joined in this by philosopher Lucien Goldmann,* who took a more sophisticated route to the same position. He aligned Foucault with “the French school of structuralism” as exemplified by Claude Lévi-Strauss, Roland Barthes, Louis Althusser, and Jacques Derrida.<a href=\"#_edn4\" name=\"_ednref4\" title=\"\">[iv]</a>With this in mind, Goldmann asserted that “Michel Foucault is not the author, and certainly not the instaurator* of what he has just said to us.”<a href=\"#_edn5\" name=\"_ednref5\" title=\"\">[v]</a> Instead, Goldmann felt that Foucault was simply repeating the overall thesis of his fellow structuralists. Though Goldmann granted Foucault a “particularly original and brilliant” place in that school, he nevertheless made clear his own skepticism of what he saw as their “fundamentally antiscientific philosophical position.” <a href=\"#_edn6\" name=\"_ednref6\" title=\"\">[vi]</a> Additionally, he added his voice to the idea that Foucault, as a structuralist, was asserting the death of man in general, or, to use the more technical term, of “the subject.”* In Goldmann’s view, the structuralists believed there was no such thing as fixed human nature, and no such thing as individual freedom of thought, thanks to the influence of social structures. Foucault’s paper, he argued, had simply reasserted this with specific regard to “the author” rather than “man” or “the subject.”\n<hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\">\n<div id=\"edn1\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> Daniel Defert, “Chronology” in Christopher Falzon, Timothy O’Leary, and Jana Sawicki eds., <em>A Companion to Foucault</em> (Malden Mass.: Wiley-Blackwell, 2013), 41.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"edn2\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref2\" name=\"_edn2\" title=\"\">[ii]</a> Michel Foucault, <em>Dits et écrits, 1954-1988</em>, 4 vols., eds.

    "content": "As noted above, Michel Foucault’s “What is an Author?” has a strange double status as a minor work by one of the twentieth century’s most influential thinkers. In his later work, Foucault left the essay’s questions largely unanswered, preferring to move toward the more general problems posed by his career-defining concern with power and its relation to the individual. He addressed this in far more detail in the major works that followed “What is an Author?” and <em>The Order of Things</em>: <em>Discipline and Punish</em> and <em>The History of Sexuality</em>.This pattern of moving on is mirrored in debates on authorship more generally. It is a topic that, as literary theorist <a name=\"_Hlk500320645\">Seàn Burke* </a>has noted, is doomed to remain open because of the sheer intractability of the figure of the author. As Burke puts it in <em>The Death and Return of the Author</em> (1992), “the concept of the author is never more alive than when pronounced dead.”<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> In other words, the very concern of figures like Foucault and Roland Barthes to move on from or shift the idea of the author is an index of the author’s centrality—and has the tendency to reinforce that centrality.For some critics, Foucault’s skepticism about the author was simply a question of intellectual trendiness, and has often been treated as such. As late as 1992, he was described by one critic as part of “recently fashionable attacks on the concept of the author.”<a href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\" title=\"\">[ii]</a> Despite the fixed presence of both Barthes and Foucault’s essays on student curricula, the day-to-day practice of author-centric literary criticism has often continued much as before, with literary biographies and author studies continuing to be produced for academic and general audiences alike. As Lisa Downing* has noted, this “may be accounted for by the fact that it is simply not easy to ‘do’ a Foucaldian reading of a piece of literature or other cultural product.”<a href=\"#_edn3\" name=\"_ednref3\" title=\"\">[iii]</a>Despite this, however, it is possible to trace Foucault’s influence more generally in modern criticism. In particular, the concerns and methodological frameworks that underwrite “What is an Author?” along with Foucault’s later work can be seen as the key influence on the school of criticism known as New Historicism.&nbsp;\n<hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\">\n<div id=\"edn1\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> Seàn Burke, <em>The Death and Return of the Author: Criticism and Subjectivity in Barthes, Foucault and Derrida</em> (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1992), 7.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"edn2\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref2\" name=\"_edn2\" title=\"\">[ii]</a> David Ellis, “Review: <em>The Death and Return of the Author: Criticism and Subjectivity in Barthes, Foucault and Derrida</em> by Seàn Burke”, <em>Cambridge Quarterly</em>, 22 (3), 331.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"edn3\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref3\" name=\"_edn3\" title=\"\">[iii]</a> Lisa Downing, <em>the Cambridge Introduction to Foucault</em> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008), 53.</p>\n</div>\n",

    "content": "New Historicism rose directly from Foucault’s links to the University of California Berkeley—the university that, as François Cusset puts it, became Foucault’s “U.S. stronghold.”<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> He gave lectures at Berkeley from 1975 onward, and later arranged to spend several months there every year until he died. As the intellectual star of theory in the United States, Foucault’s impact at Berkeley is hard to overestimate. In one telling anecdote given by biographer James Miller, Foucault’s fame on the Berkeley campus was such that in 1980 students who could not fit into one of his lectures formed an angry mob that had to be calmed by police.<a href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\" title=\"\">[ii]</a>Among those interested in Foucault’s work at Berkeley was, by his own testimony, Stephen Greenblatt,* who had been teaching literature there since 1969.<a href=\"#_edn3\" name=\"_ednref3\" title=\"\">[iii]</a> Greenblatt’s work took direct inspiration from Foucault, and from the 1980s it went on to have a formative effect on contemporary criticism.<a href=\"#_edn4\" name=\"_ednref4\" title=\"\">[iv]</a> Greenblatt’s <em>Renaissance Self-Fashioning </em>(1980), which is regarded as one of New Historicism’s founding texts, has an overriding interest in an explicitly Foucauldian examination of texts. As Greenblatt makes clear in the book’s epilogue, his work relies on the insight that the human subject is “the ideological product of the relations of power in a particular society.”<a href=\"#_edn5\" name=\"_ednref5\" title=\"\">[v]</a> His focus, therefore, was on analyzing the discourses that control this process, whether they be literary or non-literary, authored or un-authored.Though Greenblatt’s work does not explicitly rely on “What is an Author?” for inspiration, the conditions and preconditions of authorship remain a central point of focus. As Michael Payne has noted, Greenblatt’s New Historicist work could hardly help but be strongly influenced by a notion of authorship “closely allied” to Foucault’s, as shown in “What is an Author?”<a href=\"#_edn6\" name=\"_ednref6\" title=\"\">[vi]</a> This is demonstrated by Greenblatt’s overriding interest in the social and historical contingencies behind the subject and the acts of reading and writing. Greenblatt, though, is notably more interested than Foucault in carefully examining historical specifics, and in providing literary-critical readings through those specifics.\n<hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\">\n<div id=\"edn1\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> François Cusset, <em>French Theory: How Foucault, Derrida, Deleuze, &amp; Co.

    "content": "Michel Foucault’s “What is an Author?” remains a key touchstone for students of literary theory across the English-speaking world, particularly for students of Foucault. The essay has been a fixture in Foucault anthologies in the United States and remains a key part of his legacy for literary theory. It has appeared in anthologies from 1977’s <em>Language, Counter-Memory, Practice,<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\">1</a> </em>which was the first anthology of Foucault’s work published in the United States, through to 2003’s <em>The Essential Foucault</em>.<a href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\" title=\"\">2</a> It is also a fixture alongside Roland Barthes’s “The Death of the Author” in general anthologies of literary theory.<a href=\"#_edn3\" name=\"_ednref3\" title=\"\">[i]</a>Despite this, the essay’s sustained influence on literary criticism has proven limited. In many ways, the late-1960s arguments about authorial intention have died down. While Foucault’s author function is often regarded as the most sophisticated and suggestive of the theses put forward, it has also proven an unwieldy concept to put to use. With a continuous output of literary biography, life-studies, and otherwise author-centered critical works, the mainstream of criticism has continued working quite happily with the figure of the author.The author function has nevertheless proven useful as a means of situating authorship in specific historical contexts. As Jürgen Pieters has noted regarding Stephen Greenblatt’s New Historicism, Foucault’s conception of authorship brings with it an “immediate advantage” for certain forms of criticism. It “takes into account the social and historical determinations of the authorial position and the rules and regulations that delimit the discursive field in which the author operates.”<a href=\"#_edn4\" name=\"_ednref4\" title=\"\">[ii]</a> In other words, it allows, or perhaps even forces, the historically aware critic to take into account the forces authors must negotiate in order to produce their work.\n<hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\">\n<div id=\"edn1\">\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" title=\"\">1</a> Michel Foucault, <em>Language, Counter-Memory, Practice</em>, ed. and trans.

    "content": "In large part, the debates around “What is an Author?” that took place from the late 1980s onward mirrored the debate that immediately followed the lecture’s first delivery at the Collège de France in 1969. Like that audience, many critics who have objected to Foucault’s position have simply lumped it together with Roland Barthes’s “The Death of the Author.” When not forthrightly indignant, the responses to this presumed position have been skeptical.In one way or another, many have responded, that “reports of the death of the author have been greatly exaggerated.”<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> The standard arc—as seen in studies by philosopher William Irwin* and literary theorist Seàn Burke—has been to situate Barthes and Foucault together at the beginning of a narrative that begins with the death of the author and ends in with his coming back to life. Hence the titles of Burke’s <em>The Death and Return of the Author: Criticism and Subjectivity</em>*<em> in Barthes, Foucault and Derrida</em><a href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\" title=\"\">[ii]</a> (1992), and Irwin’s skeptical anthology <em>The Death and Resurrection of the Author</em>.<a href=\"#_edn3\" name=\"_ednref3\" title=\"\">[iii]</a>Even the most Foucauldian literary critic working today has charted a similar trajectory in his consideration of authorship.

    "content": "Michel Foucault’s “What is an Author?” has often come under strong criticism in the years since its first publication, but it remains an unavoidable text in any discussion of authorship and intention* in art. Foucault’s own authorial fame is—perhaps ironically—crucial to the essay’s continued place in literary studies, but there is more to it than that. As Seàn Burke noted in the third edition of his <em>Death and Return of the Author</em> (2008), the questions that surround the place and status of the author in literary studies are far from settled, even if the pragmatic stance of day-to-day scholarship tends to minimize them. Speaking of his own work, Burke notes that every reconsideration of authorship seems to raise new questions, and that “with every revisiting the space of authorship enlarges.”<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\">[i]</a>In no small part, the continuing appeal of Foucault’s work lies precisely in its refusal to settle on a specific point of view, in favor of posing a set of questions and a paradigm—“the author function”—for posing further questions still. What Burke terms the “irreducible singularity of every authorial act,” demands as many theories of authorship as there are authors themselves. “What is an Author?” draws attention to precisely that idea. As such, it is likely to continue to be reread by scholars and philosophers looking for new ways to consider authorship.

    "content": "The internet is foremost among the new contexts in which “What is an Author?” is primed to provide new theoretical insights and avenues of inquiry. The advent of a new mode of publishing has seen a vast proliferation of both authors and ideas of authorship. These have formed in response to new freedoms of speech and new forms of censorship—all of which beg the question “What is an author?” anew. Given the constant flux of the web’s development across the world, with the shifting and contested status of net neutrality and international copyright laws, that proliferation seems unlikely to stop any time soon.Among those working on authorship today are many experts and theoreticians across several fields. They are working in the wake of scholars such as art historian Molly Nesbitt*<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\">[i]</a> and legal scholar David Lange*<a href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\" title=\"\">[ii]</a> who were already readdressing the questions in Foucault’s essay from the late 1980s onward. More recently, Mark Poster* has used Foucault and “What is an Author?” to examine authority and the “digital subject.”*<a href=\"#_edn3\" name=\"_ednref3\" title=\"\">[iii]</a> Elsewhere, analytical philosophers such as William Irwin—who is deeply skeptical of what he terms Foucault’s “anti-realist” position<a href=\"#_edn4\" name=\"_ednref4\" title=\"\">[iv]</a>—are still forced to deal with “What is an Author?” in their discussions of intention.<a href=\"#_edn5\" name=\"_ednref5\" title=\"\">[v]</a>It is, of course, hard to predict what new authorial contexts will open themselves up to scrutiny in the age of new media. What seems certain, though, is that with the continuous proliferation of hybrid forms such as the internet novel, and of new channels for publishing such as internet forums and e-publishing, authorship will continue to be the object of theoretical debates. In those, “What is an Author?” shows no sign of disappearing. Indeed, as shown by the title of Irwin’s study <em>Intentionalist Interpretation: A Philosophical Explanation and Defense</em>, Foucault’s work, along with Roland Barthes’s, retains enough force that theorists are still tussling with it today.
